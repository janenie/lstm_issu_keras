 consumers may want to move their telephones a little closer to the tv set 
 UUUNKKK UUUNKKK watching abc 's monday night football can now vote during UUUNKKK for the greatest play in N years from among four or five UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 two weeks ago viewers of several nbc UUUNKKK consumer segments started calling a N number for advice on various UUUNKKK issues 
 and the new syndicated reality show hard copy records viewers ' opinions for possible airing on the next day 's show 
 interactive telephone technology has taken a new leap in UUUNKKK and television programmers are racing to exploit the possibilities 
 eventually viewers may grow UUUNKKK with the technology and UUUNKKK the cost 
 but right now programmers are figuring that viewers who are busy dialing up a range of services may put down their UUUNKKK control UUUNKKK and stay UUUNKKK 
 we 've been spending a lot of time in los angeles talking to tv production people says mike parks president of call interactive which supplied technology for both abc sports and nbc 's consumer minutes 
 with the competitiveness of the television market these days everyone is looking for a way to get viewers more excited 
 one of the leaders behind the expanded use of N numbers is call interactive a joint venture of giants american express co. and american telephone & telegraph co 
 formed in august the venture UUUNKKK at&t 's newly expanded N service with N UUUNKKK computers in american express 's omaha neb. service center 
 other long-distance carriers have also begun marketing enhanced N service and special consultants are UUUNKKK up to exploit the new tool 
 blair entertainment a new york firm that advises tv stations and sells ads for them has just formed a subsidiary N blair to apply the technology to television 
 the use of N toll numbers has been expanding rapidly in recent years 
 for a while UUUNKKK UUUNKKK lines and services that UUUNKKK children to dial and UUUNKKK movie or music information earned the service a somewhat UUUNKKK image but new legal restrictions are aimed at trimming excesses 
 the cost of a N call is set by the UUUNKKK abc sports for example with the cheapest starting at N cents 
 billing is included in a caller 's regular phone bill 
 from the fee the local phone company and the long-distance carrier extract their costs to carry the call passing the rest of the money to the UUUNKKK which must cover advertising and other costs 
 in recent months the technology has become more flexible and able to handle much more volume 
 before callers of N numbers would just listen and not talk or they 'd vote yes or no by calling one of two numbers 
 people in the phone business call this technology N UUUNKKK 
 now callers are led through complex UUUNKKK of choices to retrieve information they want and the hardware can process N calls in N seconds 
 up to now N numbers have mainly been used on local tv stations and cable channels 
 UUUNKKK used one to give away the house that rock star jon UUUNKKK UUUNKKK grew up in 
 for several years turner broadcasting system 's cable news network has invited viewers to respond UUUNKKK to UUUNKKK issues should the u.s. military intervene in panama but even the hottest UUUNKKK on UUUNKKK UUUNKKK only about N calls 
 the newest uses of the UUUNKKK technology demonstrate the growing variety of applications 
 capital cities\/abc inc. cbs inc. and general electric co. 's national broadcasting co. unit are expected to announce soon a joint campaign to raise awareness about UUUNKKK 
 the subject will be written into the UUUNKKK of prime-time shows and viewers will be given a N number to call 
 callers will be sent educational booklets and the call 's modest cost will be an immediate method of raising money 
 other network applications have very different goals 
 abc sports was looking for ways to lift UUUNKKK UUUNKKK ratings for monday night football 
 kurt UUUNKKK abc sports 's marketing director says that now tens of thousands of fans call its N number each week to vote for the best UUUNKKK return UUUNKKK UUUNKKK etc 
 profit from the calls goes to charity but abc sports also uses the calls as a sales tool after UUUNKKK callers for voting frank UUUNKKK offers a football UUUNKKK for $ N and N N of callers stay on the line to order it 
 jackets may be sold next 
 meanwhile nbc sports recently began scores plus a UUUNKKK 24-hour N line providing a complex array of scores analysis and fan news 
 a spokesman said its purpose is to bolster the impression that nbc sports is always there for people 
 nbc 's UUUNKKK consumer minutes have increased advertiser spending during the day the network 's weakest period 
 each UUUNKKK matches a sponsor and a topic on UUUNKKK unilever n.v. 's UUUNKKK bros. sponsors tips on diet and exercise followed by a UUUNKKK UUUNKKK bros. commercial 
 viewers can call a N number for additional advice which will be tailored to their needs based on the numbers they UUUNKKK press one if you 're pregnant etc 
 if the caller stays on the line and leaves a name and address for the sponsor coupons and a newsletter will be UUUNKKK and the sponsor will be able to gather a list of desirable potential customers 
 UUUNKKK UUUNKKK an UUUNKKK vice president says nbc has been able to charge premium rates for this ad time 
 she would n't say what the premium is but it 's believed to be about N N above regular UUUNKKK rates 
 we were able to get advertisers to use their promotion budget for this because they get a chance to do UUUNKKK says ms. UUUNKKK 
 and we were able to attract some new advertisers because this is something new 
 mr. parks of call interactive says tv executives are considering the use of N numbers for talk shows game shows news and opinion surveys 
 experts are predicting a big influx of new shows in N when a service called automatic number information will become widely available 
 this service UUUNKKK each caller 's phone number and it can be used to generate instant mailing lists 
 hard copy the new syndicated tabloid show from paramount pictures will use its N number for additional purposes that include research says executive producer mark b. von s. UUUNKKK 
 for a piece on local heroes of world war ii we can ask people to leave the name and number of anyone they know who won a UUUNKKK he says 
 that 'll save us time and get people involved 
 but mr. UUUNKKK sees much bigger changes ahead 
 these are just baby steps toward real interactive video which i believe will be the biggest thing yet to affect television he says 
 although it would be costly to shoot multiple versions tv programmers could let audiences vote on different UUUNKKK for a movie 
 fox broadcasting UUUNKKK with this concept last year when viewers of married with children voted on whether al should say i love you to UUUNKKK on UUUNKKK 's day 
 someday viewers may also choose different UUUNKKK of news coverage 
 a UUUNKKK by phone could let you decide i 'm interested in just the beginning of story no. N and i want story no. N in UUUNKKK mr. UUUNKKK says 
 you 'll start to see shows where viewers program the program 
 integrated resources inc. the troubled financial-services company that has been trying to sell its core companies to restructure debt said talks with a potential buyer ended 
 integrated did n't identify the party or say why the talks failed

 integrated also said it expects to report a second-quarter loss wider than the earlier estimate of about $ N million 
 the company did n't disclose the new estimate but said the change was related to integrated 's failure to sell its core businesses as well as other events which it did n't detail that occurred after its announcement last week that it was in talks with the unidentified prospective buyer

 completion of the exchange offer is subject to the tender of at least N N of the debt among other things 
 UUUNKKK which said it does n't plan to further extend the offer said it received $ N face amount of debt under the original offer 
 the stock of ual corp. continued to be UUUNKKK amid signs that british airways may UUUNKKK at any UUUNKKK UUUNKKK of the aborted $ N billion buy-out of united airlines ' parent 
 ual stock plummeted a further $ N to $ N on volume of more than N million shares in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 the plunge followed a drop of $ N monday amid indications the takeover may take weeks to be revived 
 the stock has fallen $ N or N N in the three trading days since announcement of the collapse of the $ 300-a-share takeover jolted the entire stock market into its UUUNKKK plunge ever 
 this is a total UUUNKKK for takeover-stock traders one investment banker said 
 los angeles financier marvin davis who put united in play with a $ N billion bid two months ago last night UUUNKKK both a ray of hope and an extra element of uncertainty by saying he remains interested in acquiring ual 
 but he dropped his earlier $ 300-a-share UUUNKKK bid saying he must first explore bank financing 
 even as citicorp and chase manhattan corp. scrambled to line up bank financing for a revised version of the UUUNKKK labor-management bid british airways a N N partner in the buying group indicated it wants to start from UUUNKKK 
 its partners are united 's pilots who were to own N N and ual management at N N 
 adding UUUNKKK to injury united 's UUUNKKK machinists ' union which helped scuttle financing for the first bid yesterday asked ual chairman stephen wolf and other ual directors to resign 
 a similar demand was made by a group that represents some of united 's N UUUNKKK employees 
 john UUUNKKK machinists union general vice president attacked mr. wolf as greedy and irresponsible for pursuing the buy-out 
 although mr. wolf and john pope ual 's chief financial officer stood to UUUNKKK $ N million for stock and options in the buy-out ual executives planned to reinvest only $ N million in the new company 
 the blue-collar machinists longtime rivals of the white-collar pilots say the UUUNKKK would load the company with debt and weaken its finances 
 confusion about the two banks ' UUUNKKK efforts to round up financing for a new bid that the ual board has n't even seen yet helped send ual stock UUUNKKK downward 
 and rumors of forced selling by takeover-stock traders triggered a UUUNKKK UUUNKKK in the dow jones industrial average around N a.m. edt yesterday 
 yesterday 's selling began after a japanese news agency reported that japanese banks which balked at the first bid were ready to reject a revised version at around $ N a share or $ N billion 
 several reports as the day UUUNKKK gave vague or UUUNKKK indications about whether banks would sign up 
 citicorp for example said only that it had UUUNKKK of interest of a transaction from both the borrowers and the banks but did n't have an agreement 
 late in the day mr. wolf issued a UUUNKKK statement calling mr. UUUNKKK 's blast divisive and UUUNKKK for 
 but he gave few details on the progress toward a new bid saying only we are working toward a revised proposal for majority employee ownership 
 meanwhile in another sign that a new bid is n't imminent it was learned that the ual board held a telephone meeting monday to hear an update on the situation but that a formal board meeting is n't likely to be UUUNKKK until early next week 
 in london british airways chairman lord king was quoted in the times as declaring he is not prepared to take my shareholders into a UUUNKKK deal 
 observers said it appeared that british air was angered at the way the bid has UUUNKKK into confusion as well as by the banks ' effort to round up financing for what one called a deal that is n't a deal 
 the effort to revive the bid was complicated by the UUUNKKK nature of the UUUNKKK buying group 
 the pilots were meeting outside chicago yesterday 
 but british air which was to have supplied $ N million out of $ N million in equity financing apparently was n't involved in the second proposal and could well reject it even if banks obtain financing 
 a group of united 's UUUNKKK employees said in a statement the fact that wolf and other officers were going to line their pockets with literally millions of dollars while UUUNKKK severe pay cuts on the UUUNKKK employees of united is not only UUUNKKK but UUUNKKK 
 the machinists also asked for an investigation by the securities and exchange commission into possible UUUNKKK violations in the original bid for ual by mr. davis as well as in the response by ual 
 last week just before the bank commitments were due the union asked the u.s. labor department to study whether the bid violated legal standards of fairness governing employee investment funds 
 in his statement mr. wolf said we continue to believe our approach is sound and that it is far better for all employees than the alternative of having an outsider own the company with employees paying for it just the same 
 mr. wolf has UUUNKKK merger advice from a major wall street securities firm relying instead only on a takeover lawyer peter UUUNKKK of UUUNKKK UUUNKKK slate UUUNKKK & flom 
 the huge drop in ual stock prompted one takeover stock trader george UUUNKKK managing partner of UUUNKKK UUUNKKK & co. to deny publicly rumors that his firm was going out of business 
 mr. UUUNKKK said that despite losses on ual stock his firm 's health is excellent 
 the stock 's decline also has left the ual board in a UUUNKKK 
 although it may not be legally obligated to sell the company if the buy-out group ca n't revive its bid it may have to explore alternatives if the buyers come back with a bid much lower than the group 's original $ 300-a-share proposal 
 at a meeting sept. N to consider the labor-management bid the board also was informed by its investment adviser first boston corp. of interest expressed by buy-out funds including kohlberg kravis roberts & co. and UUUNKKK little & co. as well as by robert bass morgan stanley 's buy-out fund and pan am corp 
 the takeover-stock traders were hoping that mr. davis or one of the other interested parties might UUUNKKK with the situation in disarray or that the board might consider a recapitalization 
 meanwhile japanese bankers said they were still UUUNKKK about accepting citicorp 's latest proposal 
 macmillan inc. said it plans a public offering of N million shares of its berlitz international inc. unit at $ N to $ N a share 
 the offering for the language school unit was announced by robert maxwell chairman and chief executive officer of london-based maxwell communication corp. which owns macmillan 
 after the offering is completed macmillan will own about N N of the berlitz common stock outstanding 
 five million shares will be offered in the u.s. and N million additional shares will be offered in UUUNKKK international offerings outside the u.s. 
 goldman sachs & co. will manage the offering 
 macmillan said berlitz intends to pay quarterly dividends on the stock 
 the company said it expects to pay the first dividend of N cents a share in the N first quarter 
 berlitz will borrow an amount equal to its expected net proceeds from the offerings plus $ N million in connection with a credit agreement with lenders 
 the total borrowing will be about $ N million the company said 
 proceeds from the borrowings under the credit agreement will be used to pay an $ N million cash dividend to macmillan and to lend the remainder of about $ N million to maxwell communications in connection with a UUUNKKK note 
 proceeds from the offering will be used to repay borrowings under the short-term parts of a credit agreement 
 berlitz which is based in princeton n.j. provides language instruction and translation services through more than N language centers in N countries 
 in the past five years more than N N of its sales have been outside the u.s. 
 macmillan has owned berlitz since N 
 in the first six months of this year berlitz posted net income of $ N million on sales of $ N million compared with net income of $ N million on sales of $ N million 
 right away you notice the following things about a philip glass concert 
 it attracts people with funny hair or with no hair in front of me a girl with UUUNKKK UUUNKKK sat UUUNKKK a boy who had UUUNKKK his 
 whoever constitute the local left bank come out in force dressed in black along with a UUUNKKK of UUUNKKK who want to be on the cutting edge 
 people in glass houses tend to look UUUNKKK 
 and if still UUUNKKK at the evening 's end you notice something else the audience at first UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK by the music releases its UUUNKKK feelings in collective UUUNKKK 
 currently in the middle of a UUUNKKK UUUNKKK tour as a solo UUUNKKK mr. glass has left behind his UUUNKKK equipment and UUUNKKK in favor of going it alone 
 he sits down at the piano and plays 
 and plays 
 either one likes it or one does n't 
 the typical glass audience which is more likely to be composed of music students than their teachers certainly does 
 the work though sounds like UUUNKKK for UUUNKKK 
 philip glass is the UUUNKKK and his music the new clothes of the UUUNKKK 
 his success is easy to understand 
 UUUNKKK introducing and explaining his pieces mr. glass looks and sounds more like a UUUNKKK UUUNKKK describing his work than a classical UUUNKKK playing a recital 
 the piano UUUNKKK which have been labeled UUUNKKK as UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK cyclical UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK are UUUNKKK UUUNKKK therefore UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK therefore UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK UUUNKKK but UUUNKKK therefore both pretty and UUUNKKK 
 it is music for people who want to hear something different but do n't want to work especially hard at the task 
 it is UUUNKKK listening for the now generation 
 mr. glass has UUUNKKK the famous UUUNKKK UUUNKKK less is more 
 his more is always less 
 far from being UUUNKKK the music UUUNKKK UUUNKKK us with apparent UUUNKKK not so UUUNKKK UUUNKKK in the UUUNKKK of N time UUUNKKK UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK or UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 but the music has its UUUNKKK and mr. glass has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex 
 opening N from UUUNKKK UUUNKKK the audience to the glass technique never UUUNKKK too far from the piano 's center mr. glass works in the two UUUNKKK on either side of middle c and his fingers seldom leave the UUUNKKK 
 there is a UUUNKKK musical style here but not a particular performance style 
 the music is not especially UUUNKKK indeed it 's hard to imagine a bad performance of it 
 nothing UUUNKKK no UUUNKKK no UUUNKKK UUUNKKK problems challenge the performer 
 we hear we may think inner voices but they all seem to be saying the same thing 
 with planet news music meant to UUUNKKK UUUNKKK of allen UUUNKKK 's wichita UUUNKKK UUUNKKK mr. glass gets going 
 his hands sit UUUNKKK apart on the UUUNKKK 
 seventh UUUNKKK make you feel as though he may break into a very slow UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK but there is little UUUNKKK even though his fingers begin to UUUNKKK over more of the UUUNKKK 
 contrasts predictably UUUNKKK first the music is loud then it becomes soft then you realize it becomes UUUNKKK again 
 the fourth UUUNKKK play an UUUNKKK from UUUNKKK on the beach is like a UUUNKKK but it does n't seem to move much beyond its UUUNKKK ground in three blind mice 
 when mr. glass decides to get really fancy he UUUNKKK his hands and hits a UUUNKKK bass note with his right hand 
 he does this in at least three of his solo pieces 
 you might call it a UUUNKKK or a UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 in mad rush which came from a commission to write a piece of UUUNKKK length mr. glass UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK confessed that this was no problem for me an a UUUNKKK with a b section several times before the piece ends UUUNKKK 
 not only is the typical UUUNKKK UUUNKKK it is also often multiple in its context s 
 mad rush began its life as the UUUNKKK to the UUUNKKK lama 's first public address in the u.s. when mr. glass played it on the UUUNKKK at new york 's UUUNKKK of st. john the UUUNKKK 
 later it was performed on radio UUUNKKK in germany and then UUUNKKK UUUNKKK took it for one of her dance pieces 
 the point is that any piece can be used as background music for virtually anything 
 the evening ended with mr. glass 's UUUNKKK another multiple work 
 parts N N and N come from the UUUNKKK of UUUNKKK morris 's UUUNKKK film the thin blue line and the two other parts from UUUNKKK music to two separate UUUNKKK of the UUUNKKK story of the same name 
 when used as background in this way the music has an appropriate UUUNKKK as when a UUUNKKK phrase a UUUNKKK minor third UUUNKKK the seemingly endless UUUNKKK of reports interviews and UUUNKKK of witnesses in the morris film 
 served up as a solo however the music lacks the UUUNKKK provided by a context within another medium 
 UUUNKKK of mr. glass may agree with the critic richard UUUNKKK 's sense that the N music in twelve parts is as UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK as the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 but while making the obvious point that both UUUNKKK develop variations from themes this comparison UUUNKKK the intensely UUUNKKK nature of mr. glass 's music 
 its supposedly UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK a UUUNKKK that makes one UUUNKKK for the UUUNKKK of UUUNKKK UUUNKKK the UUUNKKK radical UUUNKKK of UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK and what in UUUNKKK even seems like UUUNKKK in UUUNKKK 
 mr. UUUNKKK is professor of english at southern UUUNKKK university and editor of the southwest review 
 honeywell inc. said it hopes to complete shortly the first of two sales of shares in its japanese joint venture UUUNKKK for about $ N million 
 the company would n't disclose the buyer of the initial N N stake 
 proceeds of the sale expected to be completed next week would be used to repurchase as many as N million shares of honeywell stock the company said 
 honeywell said it is negotiating the sale of a second stake in UUUNKKK but indicated it intends to hold at least N N of the joint venture 's stock long term 
 a N N stake would allow honeywell to include UUUNKKK earnings in its results 
 honeywell previously said it intended to reduce its holding in the japanese concern as part of a restructuring plan which also calls for a reduction of UUUNKKK on weapons sales 
 yesterday a spokeswoman said the company was pleased with our progress in that regard and hopes to provide additional details soon 
 honeywell said its defense and marine systems group incurred delays in shipping some undisclosed contracts during the third quarter resulting in lower operating profit for that business 
 overall honeywell reported earnings of $ N million or $ N a share for the three months ended oct. N compared with a loss of $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 the previous period 's results included a $ N million pretax charge related to UUUNKKK contract costs and a $ N million pretax gain on real estate sales 
 sales for the latest quarter were flat at $ N billion 
 for the nine months honeywell reported earnings of $ N million or $ N a share compared with earnings of $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier 
 sales declined slightly to $ N billion 
 once again your editorial page UUUNKKK the law to conform to your almost UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 in an UUUNKKK of little UUUNKKK to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups michael s. UUUNKKK UUUNKKK your readers the clean water act is written upon the UUUNKKK the UUUNKKK rather that nothing but zero risk will do it UUUNKKK a legal standard of zero UUUNKKK UUUNKKK environmental UUUNKKK sept. N 
 this statement surely UUUNKKK your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive but it is simply wrong 
 the clean water act contains no legal standard of zero UUUNKKK 
 it requires that UUUNKKK of UUUNKKK into the waters of the united states be authorized by permits that reflect the UUUNKKK limitations developed under section N 
 whatever may be the problems with this system it UUUNKKK reflects zero risk or zero UUUNKKK 
 perhaps mr. UUUNKKK was confused by congress 's UUUNKKK statement of the national goal in section N which indeed calls for the elimination of UUUNKKK by N no less 
 this UUUNKKK statement was not taken seriously when enacted in N and should not now be confused with the UUUNKKK provisions of the statute 
 thus you do the public a great UUUNKKK when mr. UUUNKKK suggests even UUUNKKK that the clean water act prohibits the preparation of a UUUNKKK and water your UUUNKKK readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them as they UUUNKKK in the night with their UUUNKKK and waters from the UUUNKKK knock of the sierra club at their doors 
 robert j. UUUNKKK 
 national geographic the UUUNKKK u.s. magazine is attracting more readers than ever and offers the glossy UUUNKKK pages that upscale advertisers love 
 so why did advertising pages plunge by almost N N and ad revenue by N N in the first half 
 to hear advertisers tell it the magazine just has n't kept up with the times 
 despite renewed interest by the public in such topics as the environment and the third world it has n't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine boys like to UUUNKKK through in search of UUUNKKK tribe women 
 worse it lagged behind competitors in offering UUUNKKK UUUNKKK from regional editions to discounts for frequent advertisers 
 but now the magazine is attempting to fight back with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign 
 advertisers do n't think of the magazine first says joan UUUNKKK who joined in april as national advertising director 
 what we want to do is take a more aggressive stance

 the UUUNKKK magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so much UUUNKKK before 
 it largely UUUNKKK on its UUUNKKK UUUNKKK N million subscribers in the first half up from N million a year ago an average age of N for readers at the UUUNKKK of their UUUNKKK years loyalty to the tune of an N N average subscription renewal rate 
 the magazine had its best year yet in N when it UUUNKKK its centennial and racked up a N N gain in ad pages to N 
 but this year when the UUUNKKK surrounding its centennial died so too did some advertiser interest 
 the reason ad executives say is that the entire magazine business has been soft and national geographic has some UUUNKKK that make it especially UUUNKKK during a soft market 
 perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices $ N for a UUUNKKK page vs. $ N for the UUUNKKK a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation 
 when ad dollars are tight the high page cost is a major UUUNKKK for advertisers who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all 
 even though national geographic offers far more readers than does a magazine like UUUNKKK the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency says harry glass new york media manager for bozell inc 
 to combat that problem national geographic like other magazines began offering regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines for example ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest N markets 
 but the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors 
 time magazine for example has more than N separate editions going to different regions top management and other groups 
 another sticking point for advertisers was national geographic 's tradition of UUUNKKK its ads together usually at the beginning or end of the magazine rather than spreading ads out among its articles as most magazines do 
 and national geographic 's UUUNKKK size means extra production costs for advertisers 
 but ms. UUUNKKK says the magazine is fighting back 
 it now offers N regional editions it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles and it has been UUUNKKK up its sales force 
 and it just launched a promotional campaign to tell chief executives marketing directors and media executives just that 
 the centerpiece of the promotion is its new ad campaign into which the magazine will pour about $ N mostly in the next few weeks 
 the campaign created by UUUNKKK group 's ddb needham agency takes advantage of the UUUNKKK photography that national geographic is known for 
 in one ad a photo of the interior of the UUUNKKK in paris is UUUNKKK with the headline the only book more respected than UUUNKKK does n't accept advertising 
 another ad pictures a tree UUUNKKK magnified N times with the headline for impact far beyond your size consider our regional editions 
 ms. UUUNKKK says she wants the campaign to help attract advertisers in N categories including corporate financial services consumer electronics insurance and food 
 her goal to top N ad pages in N up from about N this year 
 whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain 
 the ad campaign is meant to UUUNKKK the thought of national geographic she says 
 we want it to be a UUUNKKK kind of image 
 wcrs plans UUUNKKK sale 
 wcrs group hopes to announce perhaps today an agreement to sell the majority of its ad unit to UUUNKKK eurocom a european ad executive said 
 wcrs has been in discussions with eurocom for several months 
 however when negotiations UUUNKKK down recently wcrs 's chief executive peter scott met in paris with another french firm UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK or UUUNKKK 
 according to the executive UUUNKKK 's involvement prompted renewed UUUNKKK in the UUUNKKK talks and the two agencies were hoping to UUUNKKK out details by today 
 executives of the two agencies could n't be reached last night

 the commodity futures trading commission plans to restrict dual trading on commodity exchanges a move almost certain to UUUNKKK exchange officials and traders 
 the cftc said it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites problems associated with the practice 
 dual trading gives an exchange trader the right to trade both for his own account and for customers 
 the issue exploded this year after a federal bureau of investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange 
 while not specifically mentioned in the fbi charges dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations 
 critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders 
 traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders 
 the exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand 
 the exchanges say liquidity becomes a severe problem for UUUNKKK traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration 
 the cftc may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions 
 the agency did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them 
 wendy UUUNKKK the agency 's chairman told the senate agriculture committee that she expects the study to be released within two weeks and the rule changes to be completed by UUUNKKK 
 the study by the cftc 's division of economic analysis shows that a trade is a trade a member of the study team said 
 whether a trade is done on a dual or UUUNKKK basis the member said does n't seem to have much economic impact 
 currently most traders on commodity exchanges specialize in trading either for customer accounts which makes them brokers or for their own accounts as UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 the tests indicate that dual and UUUNKKK traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market mrs. UUUNKKK told the senate panel 
 members of congress have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to UUUNKKK cftc operations 
 the house 's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of N contracts or more UUUNKKK those considered too difficult to track without a sophisticated computer system 
 the senate bill would force the cftc to suspend dual trading if an exchange ca n't show that its oversight system can detect UUUNKKK abuses 
 so far one test of restricting dual trading has worked well 
 the chicago merc banned dual trading in its standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures pit in N 
 under the rules traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers 
 traders who stand on the pit 's top step where most customer orders are executed ca n't trade for themselves 
 a merc spokesman said the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the pit 
 it 's too soon to tell but people do n't seem to be unhappy with it he said 
 he said he would n't comment on the cftc plan until the exchange has seen the full proposal 
 but at a meeting last week tom UUUNKKK the board of trade 's president told commodity lawyers dual trading is definitely worth saving 
 it adds something to the market 
 japanese firms push UUUNKKK car UUUNKKK 
 japanese luxury-car makers are trying to set strict design standards for their dealerships 
 but some dealers are negotiating UUUNKKK terms while others decline to deal at all 
 nissan motor co. 's infiniti division likes to insist that every dealer construct and UUUNKKK a building in a japanese style 
 specifications include a UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK at the center of each showroom and a UUUNKKK bridge UUUNKKK a stream that flows into the building from outside 
 infiniti has it down to the UUUNKKK says jay UUUNKKK a partner at UUUNKKK power & associates an auto research firm 
 toyota motor corp. 's lexus division also provides specifications 
 but only two-thirds of lexus dealers are UUUNKKK new buildings according to the lexus UUUNKKK 
 some are even coming up with their own novel designs 
 in louisville ky. for example david peterson has built a lexus dealership with the showroom on the second floor 
 yet some dealers have turned down infiniti or lexus UUUNKKK because they were unwilling or unable to meet the design requirements 
 lee seidman of cleveland says infiniti was a bear on UUUNKKK but at least let him UUUNKKK an existing building without the stream 
 mr. seidman says he turned down a lexus franchise in part because the building was UUUNKKK but very expensive 
 to head off arguments infiniti offers dealers cash bonuses and UUUNKKK construction loans 
 UUUNKKK device 's UUUNKKK plays back a lesson 
 products UUUNKKK have to be first to be winners 
 that 's the lesson offered through one case study featured in a design exhibit 
 dictaphone corp. was caught off guard in N when its main competitor UUUNKKK office products of japan introduced a UUUNKKK UUUNKKK recorder half the size of standard UUUNKKK devices 
 blocked by patent protection from following suit dictaphone decided to go a step further and cut the UUUNKKK in half again down to the length of a UUUNKKK 
 by N designers and engineers at dictaphone a pitney bowes subsidiary had produced a working model of a UUUNKKK recorder 
 by N however the patent status of the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK had changed permitting dictaphone to develop its own competitive micro system which it did 
 marketing and sales departments then urged UUUNKKK of the UUUNKKK project 
 but others said UUUNKKK should proceed 
 both were right 
 dictaphone went ahead and introduced the UUUNKKK in N but it has n't sold well 
 to date says UUUNKKK UUUNKKK a dictaphone vice president it has broken even or shown a small loss 
 nevertheless the device has been successful in other ways 
 it helped dictaphone attract better engineers and it provided new technology for other company products 
 the UUUNKKK recorder also helped transform the company 's reputation from UUUNKKK to UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 it gave me great pride to see the inventor of the UUUNKKK in japan look at the UUUNKKK and shake his head and say UUUNKKK says mr. UUUNKKK 
 dictaphone 's UUUNKKK recorder is one of N case studies in the UUUNKKK design project sponsored by the design management institute of boston and harvard business school 
 the studies are on exhibit at harvard this month and will travel to chicago 's institute of design and the university of california at berkeley 
 a rake 's progress means UUUNKKK out 
 one day carl barrett of mobile ala. was UUUNKKK some UUUNKKK leaves but the rake kept riding up over the UUUNKKK 
 the harder he tried to push them into large UUUNKKK the closer he came to breaking the rake and UUUNKKK his back 
 so mr. barrett then vice president of the alabama UUUNKKK association took a UUUNKKK garden rake and taped it to the UUUNKKK of a UUUNKKK rake about nine inches up 
 his crude device worked the lower teeth gathered the leaves into a pile while the higher harder teeth moved the top of the pile 
 now incorporated into a UUUNKKK rake the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK or UUUNKKK also are supposed to aid in picking up leaves 
 one customer donald UUUNKKK of mobile says the barrett rake allowed him to do his lawn in N N hours two hours less than usual 
 but other rake makers have their doubts 
 richard mason president of UUUNKKK co. in UUUNKKK w. va. says the barrett rake makes sense but it would be tough to explain to consumers 
 john UUUNKKK marketing director for true UUUNKKK corp. a subsidiary of black & decker says people do n't want to move a UUUNKKK pile 
 they either pick it up he says or they start pulling from a fresh direction

 the pentagon is a UUUNKKK house 
 living there for six years was really scary 
 the ghosts of the past are everywhere they are kept at bay only by feeding them vast quantities of our defense budget 
 some can be bought off relatively UUUNKKK 
 during the korean war gen. douglas UUUNKKK demanded and got in addition to his u.n. command in korea his own naval command in japan UUUNKKK 
 those UUUNKKK operations cost less than $ N billion a year and keep mac 's ghost quiet 
 that 's about all it costs to UUUNKKK adm. erich UUUNKKK 's ghost 
 in N UUUNKKK and the german navy threatened to attack the panama UUUNKKK so we created the southern command in panama 
 the southern command has grown even bigger since the war because UUUNKKK 's ghost sometimes runs through the e ring dressed like gen. noriega 
 the command 's huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against gen. noriega meet the war powers act 's six points cap UUUNKKK 's seven points the intelligence committee 's N points and UUUNKKK wilson 's N points necessary to justify u.s. support 
 so far no one has 
 the ghost of the soviet UUUNKKK discovered in cuba back in the UUUNKKK costs just a few hundred million the price of the caribbean command in key west that president carter created in N 
 the UUUNKKK has n't been heard from since but we keep the staff around just in case 
 george marshall 's ghost is much more difficult to keep happy 
 we keep a lot of UUUNKKK to him around the pentagon UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK and such 
 the army headquarters on the third deck of the pentagon used to UUUNKKK a lot of UUUNKKK to him but the navy headquarters on the fourth deck made them stop it 
 you see marshall had this thing about the navy and the UUUNKKK he wanted to make them part of the army but secretary of the navy james UUUNKKK blocked him 
 now his ghost wo n't let up till it 's done 
 to keep him quiet we UUUNKKK a new unified command every year or so run by the army or the air force and put more of the navy and UUUNKKK under it 
 but we still hear him UUUNKKK at night because the navy has a few ships left and to satisfy him the navy 's sea lift forces were given to a new air force bureaucracy in illinois its space operations to another command in colorado the UUUNKKK to a new army bureaucracy in fort UUUNKKK and the navy 's indian ocean and persian gulf forces to an army bureaucracy in florida 
 which brings up the worst and UUUNKKK ghost of all the ghost of the shah of iran 
 when the shah died president carter was so scared that the shah 's ghost would blame him for UUUNKKK him out to make way for the UUUNKKK that he declared the carter doctrine 
 mr. carter said he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to grab iran 
 but that ghost would n't settle for words he wanted money and people lots 
 so mr. carter formed three new army divisions and gave them to a new bureaucracy in tampa called the rapid UUUNKKK force 
 but that ghost was n't UUUNKKK he knew the UUUNKKK was neither rapid nor UUUNKKK nor a force even though it cost $ N billion or $ N billion a year 
 after mr. carter was defeated in N the shah 's ghost claimed the credit and then went after president reagan and cap UUUNKKK 
 i saw what he did to them UUUNKKK 
 it made my UUUNKKK dance with UUUNKKK 
 why he used to lay in wait for cap suddenly he 'd leap from behind some UUUNKKK of marshall onto cap 's UUUNKKK and grab him by the UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK him till he UUUNKKK up an additional $ N billion or so 
 cap added four more divisions to the army two active and two reserve two carrier groups to the navy a division equivalent to the UUUNKKK and the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK and a thousand tactical aircraft to the air force 
 he bought $ N billion in UUUNKKK ships and $ N billion in UUUNKKK and equipment to fill them and UUUNKKK them at a new $ N billion base at diego garcia in the middle of the indian ocean 
 he dedicated all these new forces to the persian gulf 
 one night both marshall 's ghost and the shah 's ghost together caught cap and threw him to the ground 
 before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the UUUNKKK in tampa and renamed it central command 
 he gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the persian gulf and indian ocean 
 marshall figured it would be good training for those soldiers someday maybe they would get the whole navy 
 they had fun moving the carriers around but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine UUUNKKK 
 but the shah still kept leaping out at cap so cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ N billion of UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK etc. in order that those seven new army divisions and three marine UUUNKKK could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 then suddenly UUUNKKK 's ghost came to visit and said what the hell are you doing planning for a land war in asia N miles away 
 we 'd get our UUUNKKK kicked 
 lucky for cap UUUNKKK was UUUNKKK and soon went away while the shah he kept coming back 
 so the u.s. found itself paying about $ N billion in UUUNKKK to various arab UUUNKKK for UUUNKKK rights around the indian ocean 
 we had great success in somalia 
 but then it turned out that president UUUNKKK UUUNKKK was not at all a nice person and the navy pointed out that the base he promised us in UUUNKKK had UUUNKKK up about a hundred years ago and anyway was N miles from the mouth of the gulf 
 but who 's counting 
 still UUUNKKK was the best we could get so we stay in bed with president UUUNKKK 
 all these reports about him committing UUUNKKK are probably UUUNKKK anyway 
 but would n't you know now that we are spending UUUNKKK of dollars and have built those new divisions and new air wings and have positioned all these ships and supplies to fight the russians in iran the russians seem to have lost interest in the whole subject 
 meanwhile congress is cutting huge chunks out of the rest of the defense budget 
 predictably some navy guys said do we still need to keep all N army divisions on active duty and all those extra UUUNKKK aircraft without bases and all those army guys playing UUUNKKK in tampa 
 could n't we save $ N billion or $ N billion a year by shifting that stuff to the reserves 
 and why not save the costs of a thousand bureaucrats by UUUNKKK central command and putting responsibility for gulf naval operations back where it belongs afloat with the task force UUUNKKK in the gulf 
 and where were all our UUUNKKK paid indian ocean allies last year when our UUUNKKK were being attacked 
 questions like that really stir up marshall 's ghost 
 he appeared late one night in the UUUNKKK of the new defense secretary dick cheney 
 marshall came UUUNKKK in like UUUNKKK 's ghost dragging those chains of UUUNKKK and air wings and links with arab UUUNKKK 
 he would n't leave until mr. cheney promised to do whatever the pentagon systems analysts told him 
 so next day mr. cheney went out and did just that he canceled the UUUNKKK navy and cut back one carrier and N UUUNKKK 
 then he canceled production of the navy 's most important carrier aircraft the f-14 and the UUUNKKK 
 on the other hand mr. cheney retained all those new land forces 
 marshall 's ghost is satisfied for now but he 'll be back 
 what with halloween coming and bigger defense cuts looming more and more pentagon bureaucrats are UUUNKKK under their desks 
 they know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by cutting carriers and ships 
 then the whole thing will start to collapse just as it did in the 1970s and the ghosts and UUUNKKK will be UUUNKKK through the place turning people 's hair white 
 gives me the UUUNKKK just thinking about it 
 mr. lehman a reagan navy secretary is a managing director of painewebber 
 the metal and marble lobby of centrust bank 's headquarters is UUUNKKK than your average savings and loan 
 for one thing there is an old master on the wall samuel UUUNKKK david a big UUUNKKK UUUNKKK painted by UUUNKKK UUUNKKK a UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 at the moment however the painting is a nagging reminder of the problems that have UUUNKKK centrust and its flamboyant chairman and chief executive david l. paul 
 in an international buying spree that began barely two years ago mr. paul UUUNKKK a collection of about N UUUNKKK works including the UUUNKKK at a total cost of $ N million 
 by midnight oct. N all of the paintings were supposed to have been sold off under orders from florida 's comptroller whose office UUUNKKK the state 's s&ls 
 centrust did n't meet the deadline 
 the collection was at the heart of a UUUNKKK plan mr. paul had in which the art was to do double duty as an investment for centrust and as UUUNKKK for the s&l 's new office tower designed by UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 the UUUNKKK is that the $ N million was UUUNKKK from the funds of this federally insured institution even as centrust was losing money hand over UUUNKKK 
 mr. paul had no right to buy art for the s&l in the first place it is n't on the comptroller 's permissible list without seeking a special UUUNKKK which he did not do 
 besides that some of the paintings that were to grace the walls of centrust actually ended up hanging in the chairman 's estate on la UUUNKKK UUUNKKK off miami beach 
 last spring the comptroller 's office called a halt to mr. paul 's UUUNKKK giving him six months to sell the paintings 
 the acquisitions officials said in a letter to mr. paul were UUUNKKK UUUNKKK and unauthorized 
 so far mr. paul has UUUNKKK but three of his UUUNKKK he wo n't say to whom 
 the comptroller 's office says it is monitoring the situation 
 though the agency could remove mr. paul it has no current intention to do that 
 it 's not like selling UUUNKKK mr. paul says as he takes a drag on a UUUNKKK st. UUUNKKK cigarette 
 the last six months has established the quality of the collection 
 there 's no fire sale here 
 despite mr. paul 's characteristic UUUNKKK the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK is finding that getting centrust florida 's largest thrift institution out of its UUUNKKK investments is much tougher than getting into them had been 
 paintings are just part of the picture 
 although mr. paul has UUUNKKK a $ N billion junk-bond portfolio to less than $ N million since april the high-yield debt market has plummeted 
 UUUNKKK itself of what is left as is required of all thrift institutions by july N under the new federal s&l bailout law may well prove difficult 
 and centrust has other problems 
 late last week federal regulators ordered the thrift institution to stop paying dividends on its preferred stock a move that suggests deep concern about an institution 
 mr. paul has a plan to bring in $ N million by selling off N of centrust 's N branches but it has yet to be approved by regulators 
 it is mr. paul 's art venture however that has drawn the most attention from investors and regulators not to mention UUUNKKK throughout the world 
 UUUNKKK shareholders some of whom are suing say the chairman and his collection UUUNKKK the excesses of speculation that set off the national s&l crisis 
 centrust shares have fallen sharply in price from a high of $ N in N to close yesterday at $ N 
 gallery directors meanwhile say mr. paul and others of his UUUNKKK have left an UUUNKKK mark on the art world and not for the better 
 collectors do n't say it 's a van UUUNKKK anymore UUUNKKK harry brooks the president of UUUNKKK & co. a new york gallery 
 they say UUUNKKK UUUNKKK got $ N million for his so certainly $ N million is n't too much for mine 
 the great collectors we depended on such as paul mellon or norton simon have stopped buying and the new buyers are brilliant men who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting 
 mr. UUUNKKK an art dealer and UUUNKKK sold vincent van UUUNKKK 's UUUNKKK at a sotheby 's auction in november N to australian businessman alan bond 
 trouble is mr. bond has yet to pay up and until he does sotheby 's has the painting under lock and key 
 when mr. paul moved in on the art market he let it be known that virtually no piece was too costly to be considered by centrust 
 he established his reputation as a UUUNKKK in january last year at sotheby 's auction of the linda and gerald guterman collection in new york 
 there on one of his first shopping trips mr. paul picked up several paintings at stunning prices 
 he paid $ N million for instance for a still life by jan UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK that was expected to fetch perhaps $ N 
 the price paid was a record for the artist 
 some N N of items offered at the guterman auction were sold at an average price of $ N 
 the rest were withdrawn for lack of acceptable bids 
 afterward mr. paul is said by mr. guterman to have UUUNKKK mr. guterman the new york developer selling the collection and UUUNKKK 
 he says he UUUNKKK them recalls mr. guterman 
 and he tells me if you want to see your paintings you 'll have to come to my house in florida 
 mr. paul denies UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK 
 it 's just not true he says 
 mr. paul quickly became more aggressive in his collecting with the help of george wachter a sotheby 's expert in old masters whom he met at an exhibition of the guterman items 
 mr. wachter who became his principal adviser searched UUUNKKK in london paris and UUUNKKK 
 and according to one dealer mr. wachter had a UUUNKKK for introducing mr. paul with the phrase he can buy anything 
 nicholas hall the president of the UUUNKKK u.s.a. ltd. gallery in new york sold mr. paul UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK in the UUUNKKK by giovanni UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 mr. hall says mr. paul was known to spend a lot of money 
 people were interested in seeing him but it was recognized that the route was through sotheby 's and particularly george wachter 
 mr. paul thus developed a close UUUNKKK relationship with sotheby 's 
 mr. paul was eager to UUUNKKK a collection for the headquarters centrust has been moving into for the greater part of a year 
 sotheby 's the auction house founded in london N and now under the UUUNKKK of sotheby 's holdings inc. was hoping to stir up interest in old masters as it UUUNKKK to build its u.s. business 
 european dealers continued to dominate the action in old masters which sotheby 's north america had lately been touting in this country 
 for several months there was optimism all around 
 last october mr. paul paid out $ N million of centrust 's cash plus a $ N million commission for portrait of a man as UUUNKKK 
 the painting attributed to UUUNKKK artist peter paul rubens was purchased privately through sotheby 's not at auction 
 in march N just N months into his campaign mr. paul was named by art & UUUNKKK magazine as one of the top N individual collectors in the u.s. 
 an unknown quantity to most of the art world paul is no UUUNKKK to UUUNKKK spending the magazine said noting that he does n't stop at UUUNKKK on UUUNKKK but also spends big on art you can eat 
 he recently bid $ N at a paris charity auction for a dinner UUUNKKK by six of the world 's great chefs but the final party cost closer to $ N 
 mr. paul says it was n't that high 
 the art collection might have come to rival the UUUNKKK ' had the florida comptroller 's office not got wind of mr. paul 's UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 in its letter to him dated march N and shared with reporters alex UUUNKKK the chief of the UUUNKKK bureau in the comptroller 's office expressed UUUNKKK that the s&l could be so UUUNKKK when it had reported losses of more than $ N million in its two preceding quarters 
 the state gave centrust N days to sell the rubens 
 the comptroller 's office eventually extended the deadline to six months but UUUNKKK its demands ordering that the book value of the collection be reduced to zero 
 in other words get rid of all the pictures 
 the state UUUNKKK noted that UUUNKKK banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director and closed with the UUUNKKK to mr. paul govern yourself UUUNKKK 
 the state agency was particularly UUUNKKK to learn that the rubens and a UUUNKKK other paintings listed among the bank 's furniture and UUUNKKK were actually hanging in the chairman 's house 
 mr. paul says that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at sotheby 's 
 he explains that he was merely UUUNKKK the paintings at home with some display because of the special UUUNKKK environment required for their UUUNKKK until centrust 's new building was ready for them 
 still the incident was embarrassing 
 it came on the heels of a number of local newspaper articles suggesting that mr. paul has benefited UUUNKKK from his association with centrust 
 for instance he got a $ N million loan from the s&l negotiated at a UUUNKKK rate 
 he owns N N of centrust 's shares 
 adding to mr. paul 's problems dealers some with vested interests insist that he relying rather too heavily on sotheby 's advice paid much too much for several pieces in the centrust collection 
 the $ N million UUUNKKK on the rubens for example was a record price for the artist and maybe twice its value given a dispute among scholars about its UUUNKKK 
 david UUUNKKK the president of david UUUNKKK inc. a new york gallery says scholars question the UUUNKKK of the rubens 
 it may have been painted instead by a rubens associate 
 the feeling among many experts on the commercial side is that the price paid at the time was excessive in any event mr. UUUNKKK says 
 it sounds like with the rubens he got absolutely taken to the UUUNKKK 
 victor UUUNKKK the executive director of the UUUNKKK association of america agrees that mr. paul paid very UUUNKKK for the rubens and adds that getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a feat 
 it 's not beyond credibility the rubens will someday be worth $ N million but whether it could be sold for that amount tomorrow remains to be seen 
 still predicting is tricky 
 i 'm forever UUUNKKK by what i see making these high prices 
 jonathan h. UUUNKKK the son of the painting 's former owner mrs. rush UUUNKKK UUUNKKK the price talk as sour UUUNKKK 
 dealers UUUNKKK of the purchase price he says were themselves interested in buying the rubens but lost out 
 mr. paul for his part UUUNKKK the rubens price saying a lot of the experts have never seen the thing itself 
 most of them were n't even born the last time the painting was displayed publicly he says 
 art prices are UUUNKKK but a good deal of UUUNKKK is involved in UUUNKKK statistics on sales 
 salomon brothers inc. the investment-banking firm in its annual tally of investment returns reported that old masters UUUNKKK N N in the year ended june N the greatest return of any of N assets it tracked 
 UUUNKKK and modern paintings not tracked by salomon are ranked even higher at N N by sotheby 's 
 salomon moreover gets its data on art appreciation from sotheby 's whose prices go up with clients like mr. paul in its UUUNKKK 
 the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK from consideration the many paintings that go UUUNKKK at auction 
 art indexes track winners not losers 
 but art that has fallen sharply in value is rarely put up for sale 
 also at any of sotheby 's auctions of old masters roughly one-third to UUUNKKK of what is offered does n't sell at any price 
 it 's not that there are n't any bids but the bids do n't meet the minimum reserve prices set by the sellers 
 in january the UUUNKKK painting that now hangs at centrust was expected to bring no more than $ N at auction until mr. paul came along with his $ N million 
 mr. hall of the UUUNKKK gallery says $ N million would have been an impossible price for anyone to ask for a UUUNKKK four years ago 
 but from his UUUNKKK point it is n't that mr. paul a customer of his too UUUNKKK for the work a UUUNKKK painting by an artist who is not a household word 
 the painting is N feet wide seven feet high 
 rather it just shows things have changed 
 mr. paul boasts that he spotted bargains in old masters just before they took an upward turn 
 they went up N N last year and they 'll do it again this year he declares 
 they were a UUUNKKK 
 everybody was out buying UUUNKKK 
 sotheby 's vice president UUUNKKK UUUNKKK says the auction house has been UUUNKKK mr. paul in selling the paintings 
 and while sotheby 's chief rivals in the art world private art dealers wo n't be happy to hear it she adds a number of the UUUNKKK have already been sold and at a substantial profit 
 mr. paul claims to have sold three paintings at more than a N N profit 
 that is n't N N and the claim is n't UUUNKKK 
 he furthermore denies that he relied too heavily on sotheby 's or mr. wachter 
 mr. paul says he had not one but four advisers and that he never bid UUUNKKK 
 after all he had the counsel of UUUNKKK from the most reputable UUUNKKK in the world 
 he says he expects to sell the collection including the controversial rubens carefully and UUUNKKK just as it was put together 
 but in UUUNKKK UUUNKKK mr. paul 's holdings are UUUNKKK 
 that is he is being UUUNKKK to put them on the market too soon and has already gotten offers that are less than he paid for some of the art works 
 after a few years you can argue there has been natural appreciation says susan UUUNKKK the publisher of leonard 's annual price index of art auctions 
 but quick turnover in UUUNKKK is like UUUNKKK your jewelry you end up with N N 
 people hold out and try to get a bargain 
 sotheby 's UUUNKKK itself and mr. paul in the matter 
 mr. wachter says mr. paul was a quick study who worked intensely and bought the best pictures available at the moment 
 on occasion he paid a high price mr. wachter concedes but he says those who bid less and dropped out were dealers who would then have marked up the paintings to UUUNKKK them at a profit to collectors 
 UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK a UUUNKKK UUUNKKK at UUUNKKK associates in san francisco considers it UUUNKKK conflict of interest for an auction house to both advise a client on purchases and to set price estimates on the paintings to be purchased 
 sotheby 's she says is wearing both hats 
 i ca n't see why there would be a conflict of interest says sotheby 's ms. UUUNKKK 
 estimates are based on the previous price of similar works sold at auction and current market conditions and are not affected by any knowledge of who the potential buyer could be 
 frequently clients express interest in paintings but do n't end up bidding she adds so we do n't know who the potential buyer will be 
 mr. paul in selling off his paintings is seeking at least a N N return on the bank 's investment so as to prove that the venture was sound 
 mr. paul says that he has UUUNKKK out over much of the globe and that potential buyers from as far away as japan and italy have examined the collection 
 because of the pressure on centrust to sell dealers and collectors have been trying to get the paintings at UUUNKKK prices 
 but so far mr. paul and his advisers are holding fast 
 one dealer martin UUUNKKK of french & co. in new york says he would have loved to buy a jan UUUNKKK de UUUNKKK painting from the bank 
 i tried to steal the picture to buy it UUUNKKK and sotheby 's would n't do it 
 they were protecting his interests 
 meanwhile mr. paul and centrust executives are getting UUUNKKK about UUUNKKK 
 mr. paul has been characterized as the great UUUNKKK or something complains karen e. UUUNKKK an executive vice president of centrust 
 the media she says have distorted his personal life 
 mr. paul UUUNKKK in agreement 
 i do n't think i have a life style that is frankly so flamboyant he says 
 but at just that moment he is interrupted in his office by a UUUNKKK in UUUNKKK who UUUNKKK coffee from silver into a cup of china and UUUNKKK the UUUNKKK with UUUNKKK 
 mr. paul says yes the ceiling in his executive UUUNKKK is UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 the offices are done in UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK books and of course a $ N million rubens 
 but he UUUNKKK that the UUUNKKK be played down 
 do n't say it 's a gold ceiling 
 just say the offices are UUUNKKK appointed he says 
 otherwise the regulators will take it for UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK everything 's got to be UUUNKKK

 creative accounting mostly by UUUNKKK forced UUUNKKK to change their way of setting standards to be followed by corporations reporting financial results standards that had become all too flexible 
 the new financial accounting standards board fasb was created in N to replace the accounting principles board of the american institute of certified public accountants 
 all of the former board 's members were UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK criticism because they were writing rules while handling clients ' books at the same time

 the former board had produced N opinions and N critics in its 12-year life its chairman had conceded 
 the climate was right for the new fasb 
 in the late 1960s some UUUNKKK failed to correct such abuses as clients picking UUUNKKK rules that UUUNKKK earnings and stock prices

 analysts on average had been expecting about $ N for UUUNKKK and $ N for UUUNKKK 
 it 's a good indication that level of profitability has peaked for the industry says UUUNKKK UUUNKKK metals analyst with UUUNKKK ball & UUUNKKK inc. who had estimated reynolds would earn about $ N a share 
 the nation 's no. N aluminum company said earnings were hurt by lower prices for certain UUUNKKK aluminum products which typically follow price fluctuations of primary UUUNKKK 
 the base metal price has dropped N N from a year earlier to N cents a pound 
 much of the price decline has been blamed on a slowing economy and the third quarter is typically the industry 's UUUNKKK period

 he said shipments are continuing at a healthy pace and the company has no excess inventory

 yesterday 's UUUNKKK recovery from friday 's UUUNKKK in the dow jones industrials had many brokerage houses UUUNKKK that stocks are a good bargain again 
 but quite a few money managers are n't buying it 
 weakening corporate earnings they say are no prescription for a bull market 
 the stock market ai n't going to do much of anything for a while says john UUUNKKK of wellington management who runs the $ N billion windsor fund 
 he suspects that friday 's market decline may have a second leg perhaps a N N to N N drop later on 
 mr. UUUNKKK says the stock market has lost some powerful driving forces namely earnings growth and the lbo UUUNKKK buy-out fever that UUUNKKK investors to bid up whole groups of stocks such as media and airlines 
 after sitting with N N of his fund in cash before friday 's sell-off mr. UUUNKKK says he bought a narrow list of stocks yesterday 
 with flat corporate profits on the horizon for N money managers say price-earnings multiples that look cheap today might go on being cheap for a long time 
 this is not a grossly UUUNKKK market but it 's not cheap either says george collins president of the mutual fund company t. rowe price associates in baltimore 
 according to institutional brokers estimate system wall street market strategists see only a N N jump in company profits in N unlike in N when profits a year out looked good they did soar N N in N 
 bulls say the market is an incredible bargain priced at only about N times estimated N earnings for stocks in the standard & poor 's N index 
 before the N crash the UUUNKKK was more than N 
 the common view says UUUNKKK cohen strategist for drexel burnham lambert is that there will be mild economic growth modest profit expansion and things are going to be UUUNKKK 
 our view is that we may see a profit decline 
 some think investors should sell into rallies 
 the market is going to wind down says gerald w. UUUNKKK a chicago money manager 
 things are a little less UUUNKKK after friday 's jolt in the market 
 he expects stocks to decline an additional N N to N N with the dow perhaps UUUNKKK out between N and N between now and june 
 after friday 's decline mr. UUUNKKK 's firm ran statistical tests on N high-quality stocks using old-fashioned value criteria devised by benjamin graham an analyst and author in the 1930s and UUUNKKK who is widely considered to be the father of modern securities analysis 
 he found N still UUUNKKK and N fairly valued 
 nicholas parks a new york money manager expects the market to decline about N N 
 i 've been two-thirds in cash since july and i continue to think that having a defensive position is appropriate he says 
 companies that UUUNKKK on debt in leveraged buy-outs during the past two years will continue to surface as business problems 
 UUUNKKK about value are n't useful says new york money manager john UUUNKKK of delta capital management

 some investors say friday 's sell-off was a good thing because it UUUNKKK a lot of crazy takeover speculation 
 it was a healthy UUUNKKK says michael UUUNKKK who runs salomon brothers asset management in new york 
 from here out these investors see a return to old-fashioned investing based on a company 's ability to show profit growth 
 the fundamentals are pretty strong mr. UUUNKKK says 
 i do n't see this as a bear market at all 
 it 's a recognition that there was much too much UUUNKKK in the lbo market 
 friday 's big fall was just a UUUNKKK by the stock market says john connolly chief strategist for dean witter 
 it was an UUUNKKK to an event the failure of a management and union group to get bank financing for a takeover of ual that does n't mean that much to lots of stocks 
 many investors have nagging worries however 
 newspapers are full of UUUNKKK about companies UUUNKKK on their debts and banks writing off real estate loans 
 that UUUNKKK investors ' confidence in the economy and stocks 
 not even all the brokerage firms see clear sailing ahead 
 disappointing profits are likely to get worse in the next two quarters says mary farrell a market strategist at painewebber 
 she thinks the market could drop about N N in the next few months then recover and go higher 
 companies with steady earnings growth could do well she says while others with high debt or poor earnings could see their shares decline far more than N N 
 the turmoil on wall street may benefit some retailers attempting to lead leveraged buy-outs of their specialty and department-store chains investment bankers and retailers said 
 managers at five chains have said in recent weeks that they intend to bid for their companies 
 the chains include bloomingdale 's owned by campeau corp. toronto saks fifth avenue and marshall field 's owned by b.a.t industries plc london and b. altman & co. and UUUNKKK inc. owned by hooker corp. which is now being managed by a court-appointed provisional UUUNKKK 
 hooker is based in sydney australia 
 the combination of so many chains available for sale the recent failures of such retailing lbo 's as miller & UUUNKKK inc. and declining investor confidence will drive down prices retailing observers said 
 the pricing will become more realistic which should help management said bruce rosenthal a new york investment banker with nathan s. UUUNKKK & co 
 investors are n't going to be throwing money at any of the proposed lbos but doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense either 
 earlier this year bankers and other investors were willing to provide financing because they assumed there would be major gains in both profitability and sales mr. rosenthal added 
 those days are over now he believes 
 competition from third parties who have cash and are prepared to buy has always existed and will continue added mr. rosenthal 
 but when prices were crazy it was even harder to do an lbo 
 bankers believed in the UUUNKKK theory that says somebody else is always willing to pay more 
 this is no longer true today 
 at saks fifth avenue paul UUUNKKK senior vice president marketing agreed that lower prices will help his management team in their proposed lbo 
 having to take on less debt would certainly be an advantage said mr. UUUNKKK 
 it would also help us in our search for equity partners 
 to make an lbo work now we are going to need more than just junk bonds 
 none believe the proposed management lbos will be easy to complete especially at b. altman & co. which is under chapter N bankruptcy protection 
 not only could the wall street gyrations damp christmas sales if consumers lose confidence in the economy but potential junk-bond buyers are sure to demand even stronger UUUNKKK and greater management equity participation 
 further many institutions today holding troubled retailers ' debt securities will be UUUNKKK to consider additional retailing investments 
 it 's called bad money driving out good money said one retailing UUUNKKK 
 institutions that usually buy retail paper have to be more concerned 
 however the lower prices these retail chains are now expected to bring should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary capital and pay back the resulting debt 
 in addition the fall selling season has generally been a good one especially for those retailers dependent on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues 
 what 's encouraging about this is that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings not liquidation values said joseph e. brooks chairman and chief executive officer of ann taylor inc. a specialty chain 
 retailers who had good track records of producing profits will have a better chance to buy back their companies 
 still most retailing observers expect that all the proposed retailing lbos will depend partly on the sale of junk bonds a market already in UUUNKKK in part because of concerns associated with bonds issued by the federated and allied units of campeau 
 prices for retail chains are lower today than they were last week which will help management said UUUNKKK harrison chairman of UUUNKKK inc. an investment-banking firm specializing in retailing acquisitions 
 but the hurdle of financing still has to be resolved 
 potential bondholders will either look for greater equity participation on behalf of management or insist the equity component of the deals be substantially greater than in the past 
 sony corp. won a pretrial order blocking u.s. sales of justin products inc. 's my own line of portable audio players for children

 a federal appeals court struck down a natural-gas regulation that had prevented pipeline companies from passing to customers part of $ N billion in costs from controversial UUUNKKK contracts 
 the court in a N ruling threw out a deadline set by the federal energy regulatory commission for settling old contract disputes over gas that the pipeline companies reserved but did n't use 
 ferc 's regulation had given pipelines until march N N to pass on to customers as much as N N of the costs of buying out their broken contracts which were made with producers when gas prices were high and supplies short 
 a majority of old contracts were UUUNKKK by the deadline and settled at steep discounts 
 but pipeline companies estimate they still face $ N billion in liabilities from UUUNKKK disputes including $ N billion they fear they wo n't be able to pass on to customers 
 according to industry lawyers the ruling gives pipeline companies an important second chance to resolve remaining disputes and take advantage of the cost-sharing mechanism 
 the court left open whether ferc could UUUNKKK a new deadline later 
 the court agreeing with pipeline companies found the march N deadline was UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK and highly UUUNKKK to the bargaining power of pipelines that were forced to negotiate settlement of the old UUUNKKK contracts to meet the deadline 
 a report last month by the interstate natural gas association of america found that pipelines ' settlement costs had jumped in the three months before the deadline to N cents on the dollar from N cents on the dollar in N 
 the court ordered ferc to justify within N days not only its cost-sharing deadline but other major elements of its proposed regulation for introducing more competition into natural-gas transportation 
 the court also questioned a UUUNKKK mechanism that could be used to resolve UUUNKKK liabilities 
 the complex regulation known in the industry as order N has been UUUNKKK contested by all sides including natural-gas producers pipelines local distribution companies and consumers 
 the court 's decision would allow ferc to change some of its provisions but UUUNKKK it will be reviewed again quickly by the court

 korean car exports have slid about N N so far this year but auto makers here are n't UUUNKKK 
 they are enjoying domestic sales that are more than making up for lost overseas sales 
 south korean consumers are expected to buy almost N passenger cars this year up N N from N 
 in fact some auto executives suggest that UUUNKKK demand for their cars in the u.s. and canada is a blessing otherwise they would n't be able to keep up with demand in the more profitable local market 
 we are very lucky to easily change an export loss to domestic plus says hong UUUNKKK UUUNKKK managing director of domestic marketing for hyundai motor co 
 as it is waiting lists of a month are n't unusual for popular models 
 demand is so strong that all of the domestic makers hyundai kia motors corp. daewoo motor co. and even UUUNKKK ssangyong motor co. plan to build more factories 
 industry analysts predict that by N south korea will be building three million cars a year about half of that for export 
 it 's an optimistic move in a industry already facing world-wide overcapacity 
 but south korean auto makers are confident that the export market will bounce back and that demand in korea will stay strong 
 currently only one in N south koreans owns a car up from one in N a decade ago 
 in the year N it will be one car per family 
 at that point domestic sales will slow down says kim UUUNKKK UUUNKKK director of marketing for daewoo motor 
 the reason for the tremendous demand is simple south koreans suddenly have a lot more money 
 we never thought we 'd own a car says UUUNKKK ok UUUNKKK who just bought a daewoo UUUNKKK on a five-year loan 
 she and her husband started a small printing business and need the car for work as well as for weekend UUUNKKK 
 pay raises of N N over the past three years have given many south koreans the money to enjoy the things they were supplying the rest of the world 
 the success of UUUNKKK ssangyong motor shows the strength of the auto market and its growing diversity 
 a part of the UUUNKKK conglomerate ssangyong group it took over the dying UUUNKKK motor co. in N 
 ssangyong began making variations of the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK vehicle 
 UUUNKKK had had a technology agreement with jeep maker american motors corp. now a part of chrysler corp 
 the most popular style is the stretched family which resembles a ford UUUNKKK or chevy UUUNKKK 
 the UUUNKKK vehicles start at $ N a family can cost over $ N 
 ssangyong which has only about N N of the domestic market will sell about N of its models this year twice as many as last year 
 it sees sales rising N N to N units next year 
 the company plans to expand plant capacity N N by N 
 by then it also hopes to begin producing a passenger car based on the UUUNKKK N and selling for about $ N 
 hyundai and daewoo seem UUUNKKK about the ssangyong threat but kia the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK auto maker is selling UUUNKKK vehicles through its asia unit 
 it plans to sell N units in N 
 kia the only korean car maker that has seen its overseas sales grow in N aims at korea 's common man 
 its advantage has been the UUUNKKK little pride sold as the ford UUUNKKK in the u.s. 
 at N million won or $ N the UUUNKKK is the UUUNKKK car in south korea 
 along with two larger models the company claims N N of the domestic market 
 ford motor co. and japan 's mazda motor corp. have equity interests in kia 
 kia is the most aggressive of the korean big three in offering financing 
 loans for as long as five years make the cars very accessible with monthly payments as low as N won or $ N 
 daewoo motor a N joint venture with general motors corp. and the daewoo group conglomerate is the only auto maker that appears to be hurting 
 shipments of its UUUNKKK to gm 's UUUNKKK division are off about N N from a year ago UUUNKKK a N N decline for hyundai and an N N increase for kia 
 moreover daewoo 's domestic sales have grown half as fast as sales of its rivals 
 the big problem for daewoo which holds about N N of the market is the long series of labor disruptions it suffered this year 
 but daewoo is expanding too 
 in fact a sister company daewoo shipbuilding and heavy machinery plans to build N UUUNKKK by the mid-1990s 
 hyundai the korean market leader with a N N share also plans to jump into UUUNKKK at the same time 
 it has a similar project for N cars a year 
 kia is reportedly also considering such a plan 
 even giant UUUNKKK group is rumored in the korean press to be considering getting into the UUUNKKK business a company spokesman had no comment

 many UUUNKKK mutual fund investors picked up the phone yesterday but decided not to cash in their chips after all 
 as the stock market bounced back withdrawals of money from stock funds amounted to a mere UUUNKKK compared with black monday when investors dumped $ N billion or about N N of UUUNKKK assets 
 fidelity investments the nation 's largest fund company said phone volume was more than double its typical level but still half that of oct. N N 
 net outflows from fidelity 's stock funds stood at less than $ N million or below N N of the $ N billion cash position of the firm 's stock portfolios 
 much of the money was switched into the firm 's money market funds 
 outflows since the close of trading friday remain below one-third their level of two years ago fidelity said 
 other mutual fund companies reported even lighter withdrawal requests 
 and some investors at fidelity and elsewhere even began buying stock funds during the day 
 two years ago there was a lot of redemption activity and trouble with people getting through on the phone said UUUNKKK UUUNKKK head of the investment management division of the securities and exchange commission 
 this time we do n't have that at all 
 of course the relative calm could be jolted if the market UUUNKKK again 
 and any strong surge in redemptions could force some funds to dump stocks to raise cash as some did during black monday 
 but funds generally are better prepared this time around 
 as a group their cash position of N N of assets in august the latest figure available is N N higher than two years earlier 
 many fund managers have boosted their cash levels in recent weeks 
 the biggest flurry of investor activity came early in the day 
 vanguard group inc. saw heavy exchanges from stock funds into money market funds after the telephone lines opened at N a.m 
 in the first hour the real nervous folks came along a spokesman said 
 but the UUUNKKK pace of call volume in the first half-hour slowed considerably 
 at UUUNKKK stevens & clark inc. phone calls came in at N N more than the normal pace through early afternoon 
 most of that increase came in the first hour after the phone lines opened at N a.m 
 as stocks rose in fact some investors changed course and reversed their sell orders 
 many funds allow investors to UUUNKKK orders before the close of trading 
 at UUUNKKK and at the smaller ivy funds group in UUUNKKK mass. for instance some shareholders called early in the morning to switch money from stock funds to money market funds but later called back to reverse the switches 
 because mutual fund trades do n't take effect until the market close in this case at N p.m. these shareholders effectively stayed put 
 at fidelity 's office in downtown boston gerald sherman walked in shortly after N a.m. and placed an order to switch his retirement accounts out of three stock funds and into a money market fund 
 but by N p.m. with the market UUUNKKK ahead for the day mr. sherman was preparing to undo his switch 
 it 's a nice feeling to know that things stabilized said mr. sherman the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK of a discount department store 
 but some investors continued to switch out of high-risk high-yield junk funds despite yesterday 's rebound from that market 's recent price declines 
 shareholders have been steadily UUUNKKK out of several big junk funds the past several weeks as the $ N billion market was jolted by a cash crunch at campeau corp. and steadily declining prices 
 much of the money has been switched into money market funds fund executives say 
 instead of selling bonds to meet redemptions however some funds have borrowed from banks to meet withdrawal requests 
 this UUUNKKK knocking down prices further 
 the $ N billion t. rowe price high yield fund was among the funds that borrowed during the campeau crisis says george j. collins president of t. rowe price associates inc 
 that way mr. collins says we did n't have to sell securities in a sloppy market 
 when the market stabilized he added the firm sold the bonds and quickly paid the loans back

 the roller-coaster stock market is making life tougher for small companies trying to raise money 
 in the wake of friday 's plunge and yesterday 's rebound some companies are already UUUNKKK deals and others wish they could 
 as in other jittery times many small businesses expect a particularly rough time raising funds as investors UUUNKKK risky deals seeking safety in bigger companies 
 even if stock prices fully recover from friday 's sharp decline the unsettled conditions will UUUNKKK many investors 
 the implication of an unsettled situation is that the thing could drop dramatically says henry UUUNKKK jr. chairman of UUUNKKK corp. a four-year-old biotechnology company that is planning a private placement of stock 
 the more UUUNKKK that indicate risk the more the investor is going to drive a hard bargain 
 earlier this month UUUNKKK inc. a UUUNKKK mass. UUUNKKK UUUNKKK said it would accelerate expansion plans nationwide and offer more of its stock to the public 
 at the time its shares were selling above their initial offering price of $ N and bankers believed UUUNKKK would sell new stock without a UUUNKKK 
 but with the company 's shares standing at $ N yesterday a new offering seems unlikely company officials say 
 business however continues to be robust and the stock market has n't affected the concern 's expansion plans says UUUNKKK UUUNKKK a senior executive 
 other companies figure they ca n't avoid the market 
 we have capital requirements says mr. UUUNKKK so we have to go ahead with a planned $ N billion private placement

 as of late yesterday the ipo was still on 
 for many the situation is especially discouraging because the market for UUUNKKK was showing signs of strengthening after several years of weakness 
 we were just beginning to look at the increase in UUUNKKK seeing the light at the end of the tunnel says frank UUUNKKK jr. partner in UUUNKKK funds a beverly hills calif. venture capital concern

 companies planning to go public are definitely taking a second look says allen UUUNKKK senior analyst at the institute for UUUNKKK research fort UUUNKKK fla. which publishes the new issues newsletter on UUUNKKK

 bay financial corp. hurt by high debts and deteriorating real estate investments reported a wider loss for the fourth quarter and said it might be forced to seek a bankruptcy-court reorganization if it ca n't UUUNKKK its borrowings 
 bay said a substantial part of its debt outstanding is in default as a result of inability to sell certain properties quickly and lower-than-expected prices for sales made 
 the company said its real estate portfolio is highly leveraged while about two-thirds of its investments are n't UUUNKKK 
 thus it is coming up short on a big bet that quick sales at higher prices would enable it to keep up with mortgage and other debt payments 
 according to its latest annual report about a quarter of the company 's holdings are in massachusetts in the midst of a real-estate slump 
 the company said it had a net loss in its fourth quarter ended june N of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million 
 a year earlier the company had a loss of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million 
 for the year it had a net loss of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million 
 in the previous year it had a loss of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million 
 although it is having serious UUUNKKK problems bay said the UUUNKKK value of its holdings minus debt was equal to $ N a share at june N based on a recent UUUNKKK

 UUUNKKK inc. reported a N N decline in third-quarter net income but the company said that excluding unusual gains in both quarters operating profit rose N N 
 the electronics automotive and aerospace concern said third-quarter net was $ N million or N cents a share down from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier 
 share earnings are reported on a fully diluted basis by company tradition 
 results for the N quarter included a gain of $ N a share from sale of the UUUNKKK pump and UUUNKKK cable units partly offset by a charge of N cents a share for recall of UUUNKKK truck steering systems 
 the latest quarter included a gain of N cents a share as a partial reversal of the recall charge because the reserve established last year exceeded the actual recall costs 
 sales for the quarter rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion with all three major product groups reporting gains 
 the company said aerospace and defense sales were up N N for the quarter to $ N million and operating profit climbed N N to $ N million mainly because of improved program performance in spacecraft and UUUNKKK contracts 
 automotive sales jumped N N to $ N million mainly because of higher sales of air bags and other passenger restraint systems UUUNKKK said 
 the group had an operating profit of $ N million against a loss of $ N million a year earlier 
 however excluding the year-earlier charge for recall of steering gear operating profit in the latest quarter declined N N reflecting higher start-up and product development expenses in UUUNKKK systems 
 materials and production costs also rose UUUNKKK said 
 the information systems segment had a N N jump sales to $ N million 
 an acquisition accounted for half the sales rise UUUNKKK said 
 operating profit rose UUUNKKK to $ N million from $ N million 
 for the nine months UUUNKKK 's net was $ N million or $ N a share down N N from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier 
 sales rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 a UUUNKKK UUUNKKK by an UUUNKKK not UUUNKKK though UUUNKKK UUUNKKK english butler in his UUUNKKK proceeds as if the realistic english novel of UUUNKKK like UUUNKKK herself still ruled the waves 
 in fact UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 's the remains of the day UUUNKKK N pages $ N is both an UUUNKKK to traditional english forms and a dramatic UUUNKKK of them 
 it implies that the british empire was rooted in its subjects ' minds UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK and argues UUUNKKK that its UUUNKKK flaws were UUUNKKK in the defensive UUUNKKK willful UUUNKKK UUUNKKK and especially the UUUNKKK of its domestic UUUNKKK 
 as the UUUNKKK stevens the UUUNKKK butler of UUUNKKK hall UUUNKKK over such UUUNKKK terms as UUUNKKK dignity service and loyalty we see how UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK the soul 
 stevens 's UUUNKKK UUUNKKK of the public and private UUUNKKK like his UUUNKKK master 's UUUNKKK all it was designed to preserve 
 such UUUNKKK UUUNKKK the UUUNKKK 
 the UUUNKKK cuts to the quick 
 it 's N the year the suez crisis marked the final end of empire 
 as he stands on a hill at the beginning of a UUUNKKK motor UUUNKKK from UUUNKKK to UUUNKKK where a former UUUNKKK UUUNKKK perhaps the victim of an unhappy 20-year marriage perhaps he hopes with more UUUNKKK than he will ever acknowledge not UUUNKKK to return to domestic service stevens surveys the view and thereby provides a UUUNKKK a UUUNKKK and the author 's UUUNKKK for the UUUNKKK of the novel we 're reading 
 we call this land of UUUNKKK great britain and there may be those who believe this a somewhat UUUNKKK practice 
 yet i would venture that the landscape of our country alone would justify the use of this UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 it is the very lack of obvious drama or UUUNKKK that sets the beauty of our land apart 
 what is UUUNKKK is the UUUNKKK of that beauty its sense of restraint 
 it is as though the land knows of its own beauty of its own UUUNKKK and feels no need to UUUNKKK it 
 in comparison the sorts of sights offered in such places as africa and america though undoubtedly very exciting would i am sure strike the objective UUUNKKK as UUUNKKK on account of their UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 an UUUNKKK landscape 
 an UUUNKKK mountain 
 but let stevens continue in his UUUNKKK comic manner his UUUNKKK efforts at UUUNKKK always fail most UUUNKKK this whole question is very UUUNKKK to the question that has caused much debate in our profession over the years what is a great butler 
 his answer is one UUUNKKK of a dignity in keeping with his position 
 such dignity has to do UUUNKKK with a butler 's ability not to abandon the professional being he UUUNKKK 
 he will not be shaken out by external events however surprising UUUNKKK or UUUNKKK 
 UUUNKKK are unable to be UUUNKKK because they are as a breed UUUNKKK of the emotional restraint which only the english race are capable of 
 despite his racial advantage to be a great butler is a UUUNKKK calling one 's UUUNKKK is not unlike general 's headquarters during a battle 
 if for example in the midst of a great social occasion such as an international conference on UUUNKKK the UUUNKKK treaty in N one 's UUUNKKK father himself a great butler once should happen to die of a UUUNKKK one must continue to serve the port please do n't think me UUUNKKK improper in not UUUNKKK to see my father in his UUUNKKK condition just at this moment 
 you see i know my father would have UUUNKKK me to carry on just now 
 it is this kind of dignity and restraint that allows stevens to declare for all its sad associations whenever i recall that evening today i find i do so with a large sense of UUUNKKK 
 we note the imperial public word used to deny private rage and UUUNKKK 
 that stevens himself is not UUUNKKK or UUUNKKK but funny and sad and UUUNKKK is entirely the author 's UUUNKKK 
 mr. UUUNKKK 's ability to create a UUUNKKK UUUNKKK voice that permits him to explore such UUUNKKK domestic cultural and political themes was UUUNKKK clear in his previous novel an artist of the floating world set in japan after the war 
 now shifting his scene from the country he left at five to the england he has lived in for nearly N years he has UUUNKKK a novel in the mode of henry james and UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 with great UUUNKKK he considers not only UUUNKKK UUUNKKK and utterly UUUNKKK sexual love but british UUUNKKK the UUUNKKK 's UUUNKKK with democracy and support of UUUNKKK and the moral UUUNKKK of loyalty it is in practice simply not possible to adopt such a critical attitude UUUNKKK an employer and at the same time provide good service 
 this employer UUUNKKK all that i find noble and UUUNKKK 
 i will UUUNKKK devote myself to serving him 
 this is loyalty UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 in the end after meeting with the former UUUNKKK stevens sits by the UUUNKKK at UUUNKKK thinking of her and of his employer and declares i trusted 
 i trusted in his UUUNKKK 's wisdom 
 i ca n't even say i made my own mistakes 
 really one has to ask UUUNKKK what dignity is there in that 
 the loyal UUUNKKK has come full circle 
 what is UUUNKKK 
 what is dignity 
 we understand such UUUNKKK wisdom must be UUUNKKK the UUUNKKK of UUUNKKK only spreads her wings at UUUNKKK 
 but as the remains of the day so UUUNKKK demonstrates with quiet UUUNKKK such wisdom can be UUUNKKK UUUNKKK in art 
 mr. UUUNKKK teaches english and UUUNKKK literature at columbia university 
 UUUNKKK corp. said its UUUNKKK subsidiary completed the previously announced sale of its air separation plant and related assets in UUUNKKK wis. to aga gas inc. cleveland

 the transaction is part of UUUNKKK 's continuing program to shed UUUNKKK 's industrial gas interests and expand the subsidiary 's propane business 
 since june UUUNKKK has UUUNKKK more than $ N million from industrial gas UUUNKKK and reinvested more than $ N million to acquire three propane distributors 
 UUUNKKK is a gas and electric utility and distributes propane nationally through its UUUNKKK subsidiary 
 UUUNKKK UUUNKKK who represents the soviet airline aeroflot here has some UUUNKKK that are wild even by the current standards of perestroika 
 in his office UUUNKKK the runway of shannon airport mr. UUUNKKK UUUNKKK throws out what he calls just ideas 
 first he suggests UUUNKKK group ltd. the international aircraft leasing company based in ireland could lease some of its boeing UUUNKKK to the soviet airline 
 then aer UUUNKKK the irish flag carrier could teach aeroflot pilots to fly the UUUNKKK and the fleet could be based here at shannon airport 
 that 's not all he says 
 aer UUUNKKK the irish airport authority could build a cargo terminal in the soviet union 
 aeroflot could lease some of its cargo planes to aer UUUNKKK through UUUNKKK for a joint-venture cargo airline 
 and then there is his notion of an UUUNKKK charter airline to ferry UUUNKKK to los angeles via shannon 
 have the freedoms of glasnost gone to mr. UUUNKKK 's head 
 hardly 
 the UUUNKKK aviation connection is alive and well here at shannon airport 
 UUUNKKK is indeed talking about leasing western planes to aeroflot and even about buying UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 aer UUUNKKK is in discussions with the soviet carrier about a cargo venture and other possibilities 
 aer UUUNKKK already has so many ventures with aeroflot that its chief executive is studying russian 
 unlikely as it may seem tiny politically neutral ireland has UUUNKKK the mighty soviet airline bureaucracy 
 and as aeroflot struggles to boost its service standards upgrade its fleet and pursue commercial opportunities the irish aviation industry seems poised to benefit 
 irish and soviet people are similar says mr. UUUNKKK 
 they look the same 
 they 're very friendly 
 moreover he says irish companies are small but UUUNKKK 
 we have to study their experience very well he says 
 we must find any way to get business 
 the two groups have been working together since the late 1970s long before soviet joint ventures were the rage in the west 
 aeroflot carried about N million passengers last year and shannon airport the airline 's largest transit airport outside the soviet union saw N aeroflot flights and N passengers pass through 
 an apartment complex down the road is the UUUNKKK and staging area for more than N aeroflot pilots and flight attendants 
 the airport 's biggest supplier of aircraft fuel is the soviet union 
 UUUNKKK from the UUUNKKK port of UUUNKKK each year unload N million gallons of fuel into a special tank farm at the airport 
 what aeroflot does n't pour into its own UUUNKKK UUUNKKK is UUUNKKK to the airport authority which UUUNKKK it to N western carriers including air france trans world airlines and pakistan international airlines 
 aeroflot thus pays its landing fees UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK bills with fuel preserving its hard currency 
 that is n't all 
 last year the irish airport authority in a joint venture with aeroflot opened four UUUNKKK duty-free shops at moscow 's UUUNKKK airport 
 aer UUUNKKK now manages duty-free sales on all aeroflot international flights out of moscow 
 duty-free shops in UUUNKKK 's UUUNKKK airport opened in july and UUUNKKK shops in UUUNKKK hotels and on the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK are coming soon 
 aer UUUNKKK is talking about similar joint ventures in UUUNKKK and in UUUNKKK a black sea resort and even has a UUUNKKK project cooking with the UUUNKKK city of UUUNKKK 
 aeroflot 's international fleet of N planes is being UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK at shannon airport 
 thanks to a new UUUNKKK agreement and the ability of irish travel agents to issue aeroflot tickets tourists here are taking advantage of aeroflot 's reasonable prices to board flights in shannon for holidays in UUUNKKK UUUNKKK and mexico city 
 the UUUNKKK fare to UUUNKKK is N irish punts $ N 
 jamaica costs N punts 
 a formal blessing of sorts was UUUNKKK on this friendship in april when mikhail and UUUNKKK gorbachev stopped here for talks with irish prime minister charles UUUNKKK 
 new trade accords were signed 
 it all started with geography 
 when it opened in N shannon was the first UUUNKKK in europe for UUUNKKK airplanes flying from north america 
 advances in aircraft fuel efficiency over the years made a shannon stop unnecessary for most western air fleets but aeroflot still flies inefficient UUUNKKK that ca n't make it from moscow to managua on one UUUNKKK 
 as a result ireland did n't UUUNKKK the soviets after they shot down a korean air lines jetliner over the sea of japan in N though it suspended direct UUUNKKK flights for two months 
 in fact aer UUUNKKK started UUUNKKK russians from shannon to new york when washington stripped aeroflot of its u.s. landing rights 
 today aer UUUNKKK is making a UUUNKKK of money from its soviet friendship 
 and with those contacts in place it could be relatively simple to add aer UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK to the team 
 then perhaps mr. UUUNKKK 's ideas would n't sound like so much UUUNKKK 
 britain 's industrial production rose N N in august from july and was up N N from august N according to provisional data from the central statistical office 
 output in the energy sector which can vary greatly with swings in the oil market rose N N in august from may but was down N N from a year earlier 
 the latest figures compare with july 's N N UUUNKKK rise and N N year-to-year fall 
 when UUUNKKK corp. begins shipping steel from the world 's first UUUNKKK plant this month it will begin testing the competitive UUUNKKK of its giant competitors 
 the new technology which creates a very thin piece of steel UUUNKKK reduces the costs of making flat-rolled sheets 
 an UUUNKKK kenneth iverson UUUNKKK 's chairman says the company 's plant eventually will make a ton of steel in N man hours compared with four to six man hours at a conventional mill 
 we 've had the russians and chinese and people from india visiting us mr. iverson UUUNKKK 
 everyone in the world is watching us very closely 
 especially his neighbors the major u.s. steelmakers 
 already usx corp. and armco inc. are studying UUUNKKK 's technology to see if they can adopt it 
 says the chief executive officer of a major midwest steel company it 's damn worrisome 
 the UUUNKKK steel industry is about to be turned UUUNKKK by a 1990s technology revolution 
 new efficient and sophisticated processes make it easier for smaller less UUUNKKK companies to make steel at a fraction of what big steel paid decades ago 
 it also enables minimills finally to get a UUUNKKK in the flat-rolled steel market the major steelmakers ' largest most UUUNKKK and until now UUUNKKK market 
 but such UUUNKKK technology is only the beginning 
 eager engineers UUUNKKK UUUNKKK and direct casting which by the end of the 1990s will enable production without coke UUUNKKK and blast UUUNKKK 
 those massive structures while UUUNKKK cost and environmental headaches effectively locked out all but UUUNKKK giants from UUUNKKK 
 there 's a revolution ahead of us that will ultimately change the way we market and distribute steel says william dennis vice president manufacturing and technology for the american iron UUUNKKK and steel institute 
 it is n't that major steelmakers have UUUNKKK ignored high technology 
 in fact they 've spent billions of dollars to boost the percentage of UUUNKKK cast steel to N N in N from N N five years before 
 moreover their balance sheets are rich with diversity their old plants UUUNKKK and work forces lean 
 but that wo n't UUUNKKK 
 it 's no longer enough to beat the guy down the street 
 you have to beat everyone around the world says mr. dennis 
 he wants to see steelmakers more involved in computers and UUUNKKK intelligence 
 the problem they 're UUUNKKK with huge plants that require costly maintenance 
 and try UUUNKKK new dollars free in a market that is softening hurt by a strong dollar and concerned about overcapacity the industry 's UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 the technology revolution is going to be very threatening to established producers says peter marcus an analyst with painewebber inc 
 they 've got too much invested in the old stuff and they ca n't get their workers to be flexible 
 no one expects minimills to UUUNKKK major integrated steelmakers who remain the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK of UUUNKKK steel used for autos and refrigerators 
 UUUNKKK 's plant in UUUNKKK ind. ultimately will produce only one million tons annually a drop in the UUUNKKK flat-rolled steel UUUNKKK and it will be years before such plants can compete in the UUUNKKK market 
 still flat-rolled is the steel industry 's bread and butter representing about half of the N million tons of steel expected to be shipped this year 
 moreover the process is n't without its headaches 
 because all operations are connected one equipment failure forces a complete plant shutdown 
 on some days the UUUNKKK plant does n't produce anything 
 at this point the UUUNKKK capacity wo n't make a great UUUNKKK in the integrated market but it does challenge them to develop new markets says james mccall vice president materials at UUUNKKK a technology and UUUNKKK giant based in columbus ohio 
 indeed with demand for steel not growing fast enough to absorb capacity steelmakers will have to change the way they do business 
 in the past says armco 's chief economist john UUUNKKK steelmakers made a product and set it out on the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 we said we 've got a product if you want it you can buy it he says adding now we 're figuring out what people need and are going back to make it 
 armco 's sales representatives visit the general motors corp. 's UUUNKKK assembly plant in kansas city mo. two or three days a week 
 when they determined that gm needed parts more quickly armco convinced a steel service center to build a processing plant nearby so shipments could be delivered within N minutes 
 UUUNKKK such relationships with major clients car and UUUNKKK makers is a means of survival especially when those key clients are relying on a smaller pool of producers and UUUNKKK with plastic and aluminum makers 
 for example when detroit began talking about UUUNKKK cars the american iron and steel institute began a major lobbying effort to show auto makers how they could use steel more efficiently by simply UUUNKKK how a car door is assembled 
 but steelmakers must also find new markets 
 after letting UUUNKKK take the recycling lead a group of the nation 's largest steelmakers started a recycling institute to promote steel cans to an environmentally UUUNKKK nation 
 UUUNKKK 's mr. mccall thinks steelmakers should concentrate more on construction 
 weirton steel corp. weirton w. va. for example is touting to homeowners fashionable steel doors with UUUNKKK glass UUUNKKK as a secure and UUUNKKK alternative to wooden or aluminum ones 
 other steelmakers UUUNKKK steel UUUNKKK covering UUUNKKK 
 still others are looking at overseas markets 
 usx is UUUNKKK drilling pipe to UUUNKKK soviet union 
 this year the nation 's largest steelmaker UUUNKKK its overseas sales operation 
 producers also are trying to UUUNKKK by concentrating on UUUNKKK output such as coated and UUUNKKK products which remain beyond the reach of minimills 
 almost all UUUNKKK programs announced by major steelmakers within the past year involve building UUUNKKK lines used to produce steel for such products as household appliances and car doors 
 but unfortunately that segment is much smaller than the bread-and-butter flat-rolled steel 
 it 's like everyone climbing out of the UUUNKKK ii and getting into a UUUNKKK says john jacobson an analyst with UUUNKKK consultants 
 after a while someone has to go over the side 
 although he does n't expect any UUUNKKK he does see more plants being sold or closed 
 robert crandall with the UUUNKKK institute agrees 
 unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar it 's unlikely that consumption of u.s. produced steel will grow sufficiently to offset the growth of minimills 
 not to mention the UUUNKKK of imports 
 japanese and european steelmakers which have led the recent technology developments are UUUNKKK awaiting the lifting of trade restraints in N 
 moreover the u.s. can expect more competition from low-cost producing pacific UUUNKKK and latin american countries 
 a taiwanese steelmaker recently announced plans to build a UUUNKKK plant 
 people think of the steel business as an old and mundane UUUNKKK business says mr. iverson 
 they 're dead wrong

 polaroid corp. 's UUUNKKK damages case against eastman kodak co. one of the highest stakes corporate trials ever is getting UUUNKKK attention on wall street 
 after N days of UUUNKKK testimony in federal court in boston the trial is being all but ignored by analysts and patent attorneys 
 most have read the pre-trial documents however and estimate kodak will be ordered to pay $ N billion to $ N billion for UUUNKKK on seven polaroid patents 
 that may be the largest patent award ever but it is well below the $ N billion polaroid seeks 
 the highest patent damage award to date was in N when smith international inc. was ordered to pay $ N million to baker hughes inc. for UUUNKKK on a patent on an oil drilling bit seal 
 the two companies later agreed to settle for $ N million 
 few analysts think it is worth their time to UUUNKKK through the polaroid trial testimony 
 it 's like UUUNKKK for gold outside of grand central station 
 you might find something but the chances are low said michael UUUNKKK an analyst at wertheim schroder & co 
 and eugene glazer an analyst at dean witter reynolds inc. said if you hired an attorney to be there all the time and give you a prediction of the eventual award i would be willing to bet that he would be off by a lot 
 a UUUNKKK trial in the early 1980s determined that kodak based in rochester n.y. infringed on patents of polaroid of cambridge mass 
 the main issues remaining are how to calculate damages and whether the infringement was willful and UUUNKKK 
 if so the damages could be tripled 
 two analysts who have read the UUUNKKK david nelson of shearson lehman hutton inc. and UUUNKKK d. UUUNKKK a litigation analyst at UUUNKKK simpson & co. think judge a. david UUUNKKK will decide in kodak 's favor on the willful and UUUNKKK issue 
 mr. UUUNKKK said testimony by kodak 's patent counsel francis t. carr of UUUNKKK & UUUNKKK showed that he worked with kodak UUUNKKK from the outset of the project in an effort to avoid infringement 
 carr told kodak on many occasions to avoid various features because of polaroid 's patent positions and kodak followed his advice in every instance mr. UUUNKKK said 
 but irving UUUNKKK a patent expert at george mason university school of law who is familiar with the case said the fact that seven patents were infringed suggests that infringement was willful 
 it 's difficult to be that consistently wrong 
 observers also wonder whether judge UUUNKKK will use the UUUNKKK method of determining damages which polaroid favors because it would result in a larger award or the reasonable royalty method 
 polaroid claims it could have manufactured and sold all the instant cameras and film sold by kodak if kodak had n't entered the market 
 moreover polaroid contends it could have sold them at a higher price and thus made higher profits because it would n't have been forced to match kodak 's lower prices 
 each side has called a harvard business school professor to testify on that issue 
 kodak hired robert UUUNKKK and polaroid brought in robert j. UUUNKKK 
 there 's nothing that says that people at harvard business school have to agree with each other said mr. UUUNKKK 
 testimony is expected to continue until early december 
 a decision is n't expected until some time next year 
 international business machines corp. said earnings tumbled N N in the third quarter even a bit further than expected UUUNKKK the outlook doubtful for the next few quarters 
 the main reason was a delay in shipment of new high-end disk drives a business that accounts for some N N of ibm 's $ N billion of annual revenue 
 ibm which UUUNKKK the poor results three weeks ago also cited an increase in its leasing business which tends to lock in business long-term but cut revenue in the near term 
 in addition ibm noted that the stronger dollar has cut the value of overseas revenue and earnings when they are translated into dollars 
 earnings fell to $ N million or $ N a share somewhat below securities analysts ' revised expectations of around $ N a share 
 that compared with the year-earlier $ N billion or $ N a share which was inflated by a UUUNKKK gain from the sale of some mci communications corp. stock and by an unspecified amount from a payment by fujitsu ltd. relating to a software dispute 
 revenue climbed N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 ibm armonk n.y. remained upbeat 
 the computer giant whose u.s. results have been dismal for years noted that revenue rose again in the u.s. in the third quarter following an increase in the second period 
 the company said in a statement that demand for ibm products and services continues to be good world-wide 
 we do not see anything in the fundamentals of our business that would cause us to change our strategy of investing for profitable growth 
 securities analysts however remained UUUNKKK 
 i think N will be another UUUNKKK year said steve UUUNKKK of first boston 
 jay stevens of dean witter actually cut his per-share earnings estimate to $ N from $ N for N and to $ N from $ N in N because he decided sales would be even weaker than he had expected 
 both estimates would mark declines from the N net of $ N billion or $ N a share which itself was well below the record ibm set in N 
 mr. stevens said he kept a UUUNKKK recommendation on the stock only because all the damage has been done 
 he said the stock has n't traded below N N times book value over the past N years which at the moment UUUNKKK to a stock price of $ N 
 the stock closed yesterday at $ N a share up just $ N in composite trading on the new york stock exchange as the market surged 
 analysts worry that the disk-drive and leasing problems will last at least through the first quarter 
 a key part of the question is how soon does this disk-drive come and how soon does production UUUNKKK up said steve cohen at UUUNKKK financial group 
 and the input i 've had from customers is that it still could be a while 
 on leasing bob UUUNKKK at UUUNKKK research said he thinks ibm has hurt itself UUUNKKK 
 he said ibm has priced its leases aggressively thinking that would help win business 
 but he said ibm would have won the business anyway as a sale to a third party that would have then leased the equipment to the customer 
 he said ibm has not only hurt its short-term revenue outlook but has also been losing money on its leases 
 bob UUUNKKK executive vice president of marketing at UUUNKKK inc. a huge leasing firm said to put it mildly ibm credit has been doing some of the worst economic deals of any leasing company we have ever seen 
 ibm is expected to get a boost soon when it UUUNKKK some new versions of its mainframes 
 but the basic technology in the line is almost five years old which means it is long in the UUUNKKK and competitors are rolling out strong products of their own 
 ibm is gaining momentum in the personal-computer market and is expected to introduce some impressive workstations early next year 
 but it 's hard to squeeze much profit out of the personal-computer business these days and the workstation market while important is too small to rely on for much growth 
 the disk drives will UUUNKKK sell well when they finally become available 
 but the UUUNKKK ibm 's highly successful UUUNKKK line is losing its momentum and some analysts said sales could even decline in the fourth quarter 
 in addition ibm 's growth in software in the third quarter was just N N well below historical levels even when adjusted to reflect last year 's payment from fujitsu and the stronger dollar 
 and expenses up N N in the quarter have stayed UUUNKKK high 
 in the nine months ibm earned $ N billion or $ N a share down N N from the year-earlier $ N billion or $ N a share 
 revenue increased N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 pepsico inc. 's chairman said he is more than comfortable with analysts ' estimates that third-quarter earnings rose to at least N cents to $ N a share from N cents the year earlier 
 d. wayne calloway also chief executive officer of the company indicated that he expects analysts to raise their forecasts for N after the company releases its earnings today 
 so far analysts have said they are looking for $ N to $ N a share 
 after today 's announcement that range could increase to $ N to $ N a share 
 the official said he also would be comfortable with that new range 
 in N the soft-drink giant earned $ N a share 
 results for N will include about N cents a share from the UUUNKKK effects of snack-food and bottling company acquisitions 
 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange the company closed yesterday at $ N a share up $ N 
 the company said third-quarter sales are expected to increase N N from $ N billion of last year 's third quarter 
 domestic soft-drink UUUNKKK case sales are estimated to have risen only N N in the third quarter well below the N N to N N growth of recent years but about in line with the rest of the soft-drink industry 
 mr. calloway blamed the slower volume on UUUNKKK weather a UUUNKKK of new products in the industry and to a much lesser extent pricing 
 pepsico said its soft-drink prices were about N N higher in the quarter 
 mr. calloway also noted that soft-drink volume rose a hefty N N in last year 's third quarter making the comparison more difficult 
 international soft-drink volume was up about N N 
 snack-food UUUNKKK increased a strong N N in the third quarter while domestic profit increased in double UUUNKKK mr. calloway said 
 excluding the british snack-food business acquired in july snack-food international UUUNKKK jumped N N with sales strong in spain mexico and brazil 
 total snack-food profit rose N N 
 led by pizza hut and UUUNKKK bell restaurant earnings increased about N N in the third quarter on a N N sales increase 
 UUUNKKK sales for pizza hut rose about N N while UUUNKKK bell 's increased N N as the chain continues to benefit from its UUUNKKK strategy 
 UUUNKKK bell has turned around declining customer counts by permanently lowering the price of its UUUNKKK 
 same UUUNKKK for kentucky fried chicken which has struggled with increased competition in the fast-food chicken market and a lack of new products rose only N N 
 the operation which has been slow to respond to consumers ' shifting UUUNKKK away from fried foods has been developing a UUUNKKK product that may be introduced nationally at the end of next year 
 the new product has performed well in a market test in las vegas nev. mr. calloway said 
 after a four-year $ N billion acquisition binge that brought a major soft-drink company soda UUUNKKK a fast-food chain and an overseas snack-food giant to pepsi mr. calloway said he does n't expect any major acquisition in the next year or so 
 but you never can tell he added you have to take advantage of opportunities 
 president bush chose martin UUUNKKK a longtime friend from texas to be chairman of the federal energy regulatory commission 
 mr. UUUNKKK would succeed UUUNKKK UUUNKKK who is resigning 
 the white house said ms. UUUNKKK a chicago UUUNKKK who previously held posts at the energy department and ferc is leaving to become a vice president of first chicago corp 
 mr. UUUNKKK an attorney in midland texas has been UUUNKKK at the interior department 
 he met mr. bush in the 1950s when the president was a young oil man in midland and mr. UUUNKKK was a lawyer for an oil firm

 california real estate investment corp. said its directors declared a dividend of five cents per class a common stock payable nov. N to stock of record oct. N 
 the dividend represents the balance of its regular quarterly payout of N cents a share of which half was paid july N in a final distribution prior to its merger with UUUNKKK real estate investment corp. also in july 
 the company said it hopes to resume its schedule of regular quarterly dividends at the end of this year 
 hydro-quebec said it notified central maine power co. it will cancel a $ N billion contract to supply electricity to the maine utility 
 the UUUNKKK owned utility said it is UUUNKKK up the deal because the contract 's objectives ca n't be UUUNKKK 
 hydro-quebec said maine regulators ' refusal to approve the contract earlier this year halted work on transmission lines and stopped negotiations for resale of electricity carried through maine to other utilities 
 it would now be UUUNKKK impossible to begin deliveries in N a hydro-quebec official said 
 the contract was to run from N to N 
 under the contract hydro-quebec was to supply N UUUNKKK of power to central maine power starting in N N UUUNKKK starting in N and N UUUNKKK starting in 
 hydro-quebec said maine regulators ' refusal to approve the contract means central maine power has lost its place in line 
 we wo n't sign any new contracts with deliveries beginning earlier than N the hydro-quebec official said 
 he said hydro-quebec already has some customers in mind for the power that was to be delivered to maine 
 nothing has happened since we signed the contract to undermine our conviction that hydro-quebec was the UUUNKKK most environmentally acceptable choice for meeting a part of our customers ' energy needs through the year N said central maine senior vice president donald f. kelly 
 central maine said it is evaluating many energy options to make up for the lost future power including new energy generation and management proposals from new england and possibly new canadian purchases 
 chicago options traders were among the big victims of friday 's plunging stock market including one small firm that required an emergency $ N million bailout 
 while monday 's rebounding markets helped other investors recoup losses many options customers and professional traders in stock-index options and the options on takeover stocks were left with multimillion-dollar losses traders here and in new york said 
 options traders were hurt worse than others on friday because of the highly volatile nature of options which often rise or fall in value several times the amount of the price change in the individual stock or index of stocks on which they are based 
 thus options traders friday were stuck with losses that also were several times larger than those suffered by many stock traders in new york 
 jeffrey miller of miller UUUNKKK UUUNKKK & co. said that given the high degree of leverage in the options market it is very easy for these guys to get wiped out 
 that may just be the nature of these highly leveraged little creatures 
 an options contract gives the holder the right to buy call or sell put a specific amount of stock or in this case the value of a stock index based on a UUUNKKK price within a given time period 
 options traders who in return for a small fee or premium had previously sold put options on stocks or stock indexes were forced on friday to buy those contracts back at the previously agreed prices which were substantially above those in the market as it was falling 
 they then had no choice in many cases but to sell the contracts at prevailing prices in most cases at a substantial loss 
 the latest round of losses is likely to be a serious blow to the chicago board options exchange which has never fully recovered from the UUUNKKK of black monday when investors fled the market because of huge losses 
 making matters worse was the fact that late friday afternoon the cboe halted stock-index options trading in step with the chicago mercantile exchange 's halt in stock-index futures 
 but while the merc reopened a half hour later the cboe remained closed leaving many options traders unable to make trades that might have reduced the losses 
 cboe chairman UUUNKKK duke UUUNKKK said that unlike the futures market the options exchange has to open in a UUUNKKK that allows each different options series to trade 
 exchange officials UUUNKKK that they would n't have been able to make such a UUUNKKK with the time remaining friday afternoon and with the stock-index futures on the verge of closing for a second and final time the cboe UUUNKKK that its best course was to remain closed 
 the damage was so bad at fossett corp. an options trading firm here that it was forced to transfer its accounts to first options of chicago a unit of continental bank corp. as a result of options trading losses 
 UUUNKKK so far is the only member of a financial exchange to be forced to be taken over by another firm as a result of friday 's rout 
 fossett still had several million dollars in capital left after friday 's close of trading but not enough that regulators worried about another potential market plunge yesterday would let it reopen for trading options exchange officials said 
 thus in an unprecedented arrangement UUUNKKK the UUUNKKK of the transfer the cboe the american stock exchange and the options clearing corp. as well as the firm 's owner stephen fossett put up a total of $ N million to guarantee the customer positions being transferred to the bank holding company subsidiary in case the market plunged again yesterday 
 s. UUUNKKK UUUNKKK iii vice chairman of continental bank first options ' parent company said the firm took on about N accounts formerly held by fossett almost all of them UUUNKKK to professional floor traders 
 steve and his firm were still worth a lot of money mr. UUUNKKK said 
 a package of credit support was put together including the assets of steve and his firm 
 the bailout was UUUNKKK together over the weekend with officials from the federal reserve board securities and exchange commission comptroller of the currency and treasury as well as the options exchanges 
 it was great to have the luxury of time mr. UUUNKKK said 
 at one point an options industry official had to talk the federal reserve bank of chicago 's night UUUNKKK into giving him the home phone number of UUUNKKK UUUNKKK chicago fed president 
 first options did n't have to put any money into the bailout 
 yesterday 's rally in the stock futures and options markets led cboe and amex officials to conclude that the $ N million in guarantees almost certainly wo n't need to be tapped by first options 
 the fossett firm had some losses and liquidity problems during the october N crash as well mr. UUUNKKK said 
 a federal official said that continental bank worked with securities and banking regulators over the weekend to fashion the fossett bailout but that conditions were n't UUUNKKK by those agencies 
 it was their business decision the official said 
 officials at options clearing corp. which processes all options trades for u.s. exchanges said that the $ N million guarantee was unprecedented but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets 
 it was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps said paul stevens UUUNKKK president and chief operating officer 
 mr. stevens declined to give the specific contributions to the $ N million guarantee from each participant 
 but cboe and amex officials said that options clearing corp. contributed $ N million to the guarantee the cboe put up $ N million the amex added $ N million and $ N million came from mr. fossett 's own assets 
 mr. fossett could n't be reached to comment

 on days that i 'm really busy says ms. foster who works in public relations for the company it seems UUUNKKK to take time off for a massage 
 although such sessions may never replace coffee breaks on-site massage as it is known in the trade is certainly UUUNKKK corporate america 
 in some companies middle managers UUUNKKK massage UUUNKKK into the office fearful that UUUNKKK executives wo n't approve 
 ms. foster 's UUUNKKK is nothing like the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK enjoyed by UUUNKKK visitors 
 nor does it at all resemble despite what some executives think the more intimate variety offered at specialty UUUNKKK in bad parts of town 
 on the contrary office UUUNKKK usually take place in UUUNKKK UUUNKKK conference rooms where UUUNKKK employees relax in specially designed chairs fully UUUNKKK 
 the massages last N minutes and typically cost about $ N

 anthony UUUNKKK UUUNKKK the company 's chairman UUUNKKK by her firm touch saying regular massages are a UUUNKKK for his old football injuries 
 massage advocates say that UUUNKKK the head UUUNKKK neck and back can go a long way toward easing tension and improving morale 
 they also insist that UUUNKKK is a basic need as powerful as the need for food or sleep and that the office is as good a place as any to do it 
 the blood flows to your head you feel UUUNKKK and you do n't feel tension around the head or neck says UUUNKKK UUUNKKK an operations supervisor at the social security office in grand UUUNKKK mich. where massages began last month 
 when you leave the room after your massage people say you look like you 're UUUNKKK 
 adds UUUNKKK UUUNKKK the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK who UUUNKKK her trade in the grand UUUNKKK office they fall in love with my hands 
 not everyone however is at ease with office massage 
 three years ago the internal revenue service 's office in san jose calif. opened its doors to on-site massage 
 and even though employees paid the bill taxpayers UUUNKKK 
 sometimes with the release of stress you hear UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK coming out of the room explains morgan banks the agency 's health specialist 
 and you ca n't have taxpayers coming into an audit hearing UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK 
 last month the complaints UUUNKKK and the massages ended 
 now we 're looking for a room with UUUNKKK walls ms. banks says 
 massage also has an image problem to contend with 
 some UUUNKKK have tried to get around this by calling themselves UUUNKKK and describing their office visits as UUUNKKK breaks 
 but massage no matter how UUUNKKK is still associated in many minds with UUUNKKK fronts for UUUNKKK and that makes some executives nervous 
 last year the research and development division of weyerhaeuser co. the large UUUNKKK concern invited a UUUNKKK to its UUUNKKK wash. offices 
 phil UUUNKKK a software engineer was an eager customer 
 you build up a lot of tension working at a terminal all day he says 
 but after about eight months the vice president of the division ed UUUNKKK learned about the sessions and brought them to a halt 
 mr. UUUNKKK says his only beef was that the massages were being given in a company conference room the department 's UUUNKKK health facility would have been fine 
 in my view massages should be managed with an appropriate UUUNKKK of males and UUUNKKK around he says 
 given such attitudes some corporate UUUNKKK prefer to go about their business quietly 
 russell UUUNKKK of park UUUNKKK n.j. says he has been working for the past year at a huge chemical and manufacturing concern in new york UUUNKKK to the company 's executives 
 he visits the same department every two or three weeks 
 his massage chair is kept in a UUUNKKK and a secretary UUUNKKK him past security 
 this is common with a lot of large companies says mr. UUUNKKK who worked for american telephone & telegraph co. for N years before choosing his current trade 
 managers he contends are afraid how they 're going to look in the eyes of their UUUNKKK 
 my vision is to change human UUUNKKK UUUNKKK touch 
 my attitude is let 's come out of the UUUNKKK 
 occasionally all that 's needed is a little UUUNKKK 
 UUUNKKK UUUNKKK a st. louis UUUNKKK won over officials at emerson electric co. a maker of electrical and electronic equipment by providing documents and other articles UUUNKKK the UUUNKKK benefits of massage 
 she notes that she also UUUNKKK UUUNKKK during her weekly visits 
 i pull my hair back wear a little makeup and look corporate says ms. UUUNKKK who has been visiting emerson since january 
 if i go in there as i normally dress they 'd ask who is this UUUNKKK 
 the UUUNKKK father of on-site massage is david palmer a UUUNKKK san francisco UUUNKKK whose mission is to save the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 to help do this mr. palmer developed a portable massage chair three years ago that he hopes will bring structured UUUNKKK into mainstream america 
 the culture is not ready to take off its clothes lie down and be touched for an hour for $ N he says 
 the idea is to keep the clothes on and to keep people UUUNKKK 
 the chair is a way to package massage 
 sitting in one of mr. palmer 's chairs which cost $ N and have since been UUUNKKK by others is a bit like UUUNKKK a UUUNKKK 
 customers lean forward rest their UUUNKKK on side supports and UUUNKKK their face in UUUNKKK on the back of the chair 
 ms. UUUNKKK the grand UUUNKKK UUUNKKK says she has heard the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK compared to something out of the spanish UUUNKKK 
 mr. palmer who serves as president of the on-site massage association and writes an industry newsletter says some N practitioners out of about N certified UUUNKKK across the country now use massage chairs in the workplace as well as on street corners in airports and UUUNKKK and at UUUNKKK and other UUUNKKK where UUUNKKK people can be found 
 UUUNKKK UUUNKKK a UUUNKKK in UUUNKKK colo. had a scary experience while UUUNKKK a man in a UUUNKKK supermarket as part of a store promotion 
 three minutes into the massage the man UUUNKKK up began shaking and turned red 
 UUUNKKK were called 
 a week later the man told mr. UUUNKKK he had suffered a mild heart attack unrelated to the massage 
 it was a powerful point in my career says the UUUNKKK mr. UUUNKKK who has since taken out a $ N million liability policy for his business 
 but he pulled through and after the UUUNKKK left there were still six people in line waiting for a massage 
 the next woman was older and i was afraid to touch her 
 but it 's like falling off a horse and getting back on 
 despite the number of fans that office massage has won some UUUNKKK look down on it arguing that naked UUUNKKK UUUNKKK are the only way to go 
 linda UUUNKKK who does UUUNKKK work in pittsburgh says that while on-site massage is better than nothing tired workers should realize it is only the tip of the UUUNKKK 
 whole areas of their bodies are neglected she says adding that clothes UUUNKKK the experience 
 there 's nothing like skin to skin 
 in what is believed to be the first cancellation of a loan to china since the june N killings in beijing an international bank syndicate has terminated a $ N million credit for a shanghai property project 
 the syndicate led by UUUNKKK asia ltd. agreed last november to provide the loan to asia development corp. a u.s. property developer 
 but several weeks ago in the wake of the beijing killings the loan was canceled according to bankers and executives close to the project 
 asia development and UUUNKKK declined to comment on the move 
 lenders had doubts about the project even before june N but the harsh crackdown which caused many businesses to UUUNKKK their china transactions gave the banks the out they wanted says an official close to the shanghai venture 
 the decision to cancel the loan UUUNKKK the tough attitude bankers have taken toward china since june N 
 while some commercial lending has resumed international lenders remain nervous about china 's economic troubles and foreign debt $ N billion at the end of N 
 many loans are being UUUNKKK especially those tied to the hotel sector which has been hit hard by a UUUNKKK N tourism slump 
 many bankers view UUUNKKK loans as particularly risky 
 the canceled shanghai loan leaves asia development a small concern UUUNKKK with a UUUNKKK UUUNKKK apartment building and heavy debts 
 the company owes $ N million to the UUUNKKK on group the project 's hong kong contractor and a significant though unspecified amount in legal fees to UUUNKKK brothers a u.s. law firm the sources say 
 the project known as lotus mansion has been mired in controversy 
 when the loan agreement was announced it was hailed as one of the first western-style financing transactions ever used in china 
 unlike most loans to china there was no chinese UUUNKKK 
 instead the banks secured a promise from state-owned bank of communications that it would lend asia development the entire $ N million at maturity to finance repayment of the original borrowing 
 the loan was to have UUUNKKK in just two to three years as soon as construction was completed 
 but in a letter sent in august to asia development UUUNKKK said the loan was terminated because the developer had failed to deliver adequate financial data and pay certain fees to the UUUNKKK committee on time according to officials close to the project 
 creditors involved in the project contend however that the termination actually had nothing to do with these technical violations 
 instead the creditors say the loan fell victim to nervousness about china 's political turmoil as well as to concern about the loan 's security 
 the bank syndicate is made up mostly of european banks but it includes china 's state-owned UUUNKKK industrial bank 
 the N banks in the syndicate sustained no monetary losses because none of the credit facility had been drawn down 
 k mart corp. agreed to acquire pace membership warehouse inc. for $ N a share or $ N million in a move to expand its presence in the rapidly growing UUUNKKK business 
 the proposed merger comes as k mart 's profit is declining and sales at its core discount stores are rising more slowly than at such competitors as UUUNKKK stores inc 
 k mart based in UUUNKKK mich. recently said net income would fall for the third consecutive quarter after a N N drop in the first half of its current fiscal year 
 the membership UUUNKKK concept has great potential the company 's chairman joseph e. UUUNKKK said in a statement 
 warehouse clubs typically carry general merchandise and food products which they sell for close to wholesale prices in UUUNKKK stores 
 shoppers many of whom operate small businesses pay annual membership fees which provide an income base for the stores 
 k mart tested the UUUNKKK sector last year with its acquisition of a N N interest in UUUNKKK inc 
 but the UUUNKKK chain which operates as a joint venture between k mart and shv holdings n.v. of the netherlands has only six stores and annual sales that one analyst estimated at about $ N million 
 UUUNKKK pace based in UUUNKKK colo. operates N UUUNKKK stores 
 the company had losses for several years before turning profitable in fiscal N 
 in the year ended jan. N pace UUUNKKK up profit of $ N million or N cents a share after a tax-loss carry-forward on sales of $ N billion and analysts expect its results to continue to improve 
 the company turned the corner fairly recently in profitability said UUUNKKK UUUNKKK of painewebber inc. who had been forecasting a N N jump in pace 's net income from operations this year and another N N increase next year 
 warehouse productivity is really beginning to take off 
 but some analysts contend k mart has agreed to pay too much for pace 
 even if you look at it as a turnaround situation it 's expensive said wayne UUUNKKK of prudential-bache securities inc 
 in my opinion you would only pay that kind of price if you were getting a premier player in the industry 
 ms. UUUNKKK of painewebber raised a more fundamental question about the deal 
 if k mart ca n't get its act together in discounting why is it spending time worrying about other growing markets 
 she said i would say k mart 's number one job is to address its market-share loss in discount stores which longer-term will lead to improved profit margins 
 at that point perhaps diversification would be appropriate 
 but k mart 's mr. UUUNKKK is intent on pushing the company into new retail businesses 
 for instance k mart is opening big food and general merchandise stores called UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK stores specializing in office products and sporting goods 
 it also operates UUUNKKK pay less drug stores and builders square home improvement stores 
 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange k mart closed yesterday at $ N a share up N cents 
 pace rose $ N to close at $ N a share in national over-the-counter trading 
 a k mart spokesman said the acquisition would be financed with short-term borrowings 
 under terms of the agreement a k mart subsidiary will soon make a tender offer for pace shares 
 among the conditions of the offer is that pace shareholders tender a majority of the company 's shares outstanding 
 the companies said pace would ill continue to operate under its present management 
 g. william UUUNKKK president of UUUNKKK stations was named chief executive officer of the unit of this media company effective jan. N

 traders nervously watching their quotron UUUNKKK machines yesterday morning were stunned to see the dow jones industrial average plummet N points in seconds 
 a minute later it soared N points then UUUNKKK back down N points N below friday 's close 
 it was crazy said neil UUUNKKK general partner of UUUNKKK capital corp 
 it was like flying without a pilot in the front of the plane 
 but those who said this ca n't be happening were right 
 the UUUNKKK were wrong 
 quotron systems inc. a citicorp unit blamed the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK on a timing problem in our software caused by the enormous early volume about N million shares in the first hour of new york stock exchange trading 
 the prices of the individual stocks that make up the average were correct quotron said but the average was wrong 
 meanwhile there was an awful lot of confusion 
 at about N a.m. on the over-the-counter trading desk at a major brokerage firm a veteran trader who buys and sells some of the most active stocks looked at a senior official and asked what 's going on 
 is the market up or down 
 at the time quotron was reporting that the industrial average was down N points 
 in fact it was up N 
 UUUNKKK stark a vice president who heads the trading desk at dillon read capital corp. said that once she figured out the quotron numbers were wrong she called brokers to tell them 
 it 's been kind of UUUNKKK to say the least she said 
 to UUUNKKK matters further when ual corp. stock finally opened on the new york stock exchange at N a.m. the price was listed at $ N a share up about $ N from friday in fact its true price was $ N down $ N 
 that was the new york stock exchange 's UUUNKKK 
 a spokesman cited a technical error and declined to elaborate 
 and there were other UUUNKKK 
 when the market opened at N a.m. est a reporter for the reuters UUUNKKK UUUNKKK the industrial average 's drop as a N N decline when it really was down N N 
 it was a case of human error which we found almost immediately and corrected a spokesman for reuter in new york said 
 meanwhile some currency traders at west german banks in frankfurt said they sold dollars on the news and had to buy them back later at higher prices 
 but it was the quotron problems that had UUUNKKK effects 
 dillon read 's ms. stark said in early afternoon that she was still UUUNKKK prices and other data as subject to UUUNKKK and she said portfolio managers continued to question the numbers they saw on the screen 
 it was the second time in less than a week that quotron has had problems UUUNKKK the industrial average 
 at the start of trading last wednesday the average appeared to plunge more than N points 
 actually it was down only a few points at the time 
 quotron said that UUUNKKK which lasted nine minutes resulted from a failure to adjust for a UUUNKKK stock split at philip morris UUUNKKK 
 a quotron spokeswoman said recent software changes may have contributed to yesterday 's problems 
 she said quotron switched to a backup system until the problems were corrected 
 today of all days she UUUNKKK 
 the eyes of the world were watching us 
 steven f. UUUNKKK was named a senior vice president of this graphics equipment company

 houston attorney dale friend representing a plaintiff in a damage suit says he has negotiated a settlement that will strike a blow for his client 
 literally 
 it turns out mr. friend 's client UUUNKKK parks of cincinnati did n't like the way defense attorney tom alexander acted during the legal proceedings 
 so she has agreed to UUUNKKK monetary damages against mr. alexander 's client in return for the right to UUUNKKK the attorney 
 ms. parks 's mother also gets to UUUNKKK mr. alexander 
 so does mr. friend and his law partner UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 the bizarre arrangement grows out of mr. alexander 's representation of UUUNKKK construction co. one of several defendants in a UUUNKKK death lawsuit brought by ms. parks the widow of a construction worker killed in january N while working on a new houston convention center 
 last month mr. friend says mr. alexander 's associate agreed that UUUNKKK would pay $ N as part of an overall settlement 
 but mr. alexander UUUNKKK the deal at the last minute UUUNKKK the plaintiff 's side 
 i never agreed to it mr. alexander says adding that it 's not necessary to pay these UUUNKKK settlements 
 when ms. parks and her mother heard about what had happened mr. friend says they UUUNKKK that they would like to give mr. alexander a good UUUNKKK 
 mr. friend says he passed that along to his adversary and soon they were talking about the ground rules under which UUUNKKK could keep its money and the plaintiffs could take a shot at mr. alexander 
 although time and place have yet to be determined some details are in place 
 mr. friend says he agreed to strike mr. alexander above the belt 
 ms. parks and her mother indicated they want to catch him UUUNKKK from behind he says 
 mr. alexander for his part insisted that the UUUNKKK ca n't UUUNKKK their UUUNKKK rights to anyone else ca n't use a blunt instrument and ca n't take a running start 
 mr. alexander says he UUUNKKK the agreement which has n't been submitted to a judge as something of a joke 
 however he acknowledges they have the option of taking a UUUNKKK at me if they really want to 
 mr. friend says his side is dead serious 
 although they do n't UUUNKKK delivering any UUUNKKK UUUNKKK he says that mr. alexander will be asked to sign a release from liability just in case 
 after two years of drought it UUUNKKK money in the stock-index futures markets yesterday 
 as financial markets rebounded trading volume in the chicago mercantile exchange 's huge standard & poor 's N stock-index futures pit soared reaching UUUNKKK levels for the first time since october N 
 the sudden influx of liquidity enabled several traders to reap UUUNKKK UUUNKKK in a matter of minutes as prices soared traders said 
 guys were UUUNKKK money in there today said john UUUNKKK a futures broker for elders futures inc. in chicago 
 the s&p N futures contract which moves in UUUNKKK of an index point under normal conditions jumped two to three points in seconds early yesterday after an initial downturn then moved strongly higher the rest of the day 
 each index point represents a $ N profit for each s&p N contract held 
 for the first time since the N crash traders said that they were able to trade several hundred s&p N contracts at a time in a highly liquid market 
 many institutions and individual investors have UUUNKKK away from stock-index futures blaming them for speeding the stock market crash on black monday two years ago 
 since the crash many futures traders have n't assumed large positions for fear that the s&p N market with much of its customer order flow missing would dry up if prices turned against them 
 more than N traders UUUNKKK the s&p N futures pit to await the opening bell 
 traders were shouting bids and offers a full five minutes before the start of trading at N am 
 the contract fell five points at the open to N the maximum opening move allowed under UUUNKKK adopted by the merc to stem a market slide 
 but several traders quickly stepped up and bid for contracts driving prices sharply higher 
 the market UUUNKKK near friday 's closing price of N for about a half hour moving several index points higher or lower in seconds then broke higher and did n't look back 
 the s&p N contract that expires in december closed up a record N points on volume of nearly N contracts 
 traders five feet from each other were making bids and offers that were a full point apart said one s&p N broker 
 you could buy at the bid and sell at the offer and make a fortune he UUUNKKK 
 several of wall street 's largest securities firms including salomon brothers inc. and painewebber inc. were also large buyers traders said 
 salomon brothers was among the largest sellers of stock-index futures last week traders said 
 brokerage firms as a rule do n't comment on their market activity 
 unlike the week following black monday two years ago individual traders in the s&p N pit were also being UUUNKKK UUUNKKK about their one-day profits 
 with the fbi around here UUUNKKK rights are a thing of the past said one trader referring to the federal investigation of futures trading that so far has resulted in N UUUNKKK UUUNKKK against individuals on the merc and the chicago board of trade 
 the market for $ N billion of high-yield junk bonds regained some of its footing as the dow jones industrial average rebounded from friday 's plunge 
 but the junk recovery led by the bellwether rjr holdings bonds was UUUNKKK 
 no trading existed for the vast majority of junk bonds securities industry officials said 
 on friday trading in practically every issue ground to a halt as potential buyers fled and brokerage firms were unwilling to provide bid and offer prices for most issues 
 nothing traded on friday and people were n't really sure where the market should have opened yesterday said raymond UUUNKKK UUUNKKK of merchant banking at merrill lynch & co 
 but we had a fairly active day yesterday 
 at drexel burnham lambert inc. the leading underwriter of junk bonds i was prepared to be in a very bad mood tonight said david UUUNKKK a junk bond trader 
 now i feel maybe there 's a little bit of euphoria 
 but before the stock market rebounded from a sharp early sell-off yesterday he said you could n't buy junk bonds and you could n't give them away 
 yesterday 's rally was led by rjr holdings N N N bonds which initially tumbled three points or $ N for each $ N face amount to N N before rebounding to N N 
 bonds issued by UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK and american standard also showed big gains recovering almost all their losses from friday and early yesterday 
 but traders said the junk bond market increasingly is UUUNKKK into a UUUNKKK group in which trades can be executed easily and a larger group of UUUNKKK bonds in which liquidity or the ability to trade without too much difficulty has steadily deteriorated this year 
 liquidity has n't returned to the vast middle ground of the market said mr. UUUNKKK of merrill 
 the UUUNKKK are still UUUNKKK said mr. UUUNKKK of drexel 
 analysts are concerned that much of the high-yield market will remain UUUNKKK for investors 
 paul UUUNKKK associate professor at the massachusetts institute of technology 's sloan school of management citing a pattern of junk-bond default rates that are low in the early years after issuance and rise later says we 're now in a period where we 're starting to see defaults from the big issue years of N to N 
 mark UUUNKKK a senior vice president at standard & poor 's corp. confirms that there is increasing concern about the future liquidity of the junk bond market 
 junk bonds are a highly UUUNKKK market said lewis UUUNKKK vice chairman of smith barney harris upham & co 
 there 's a whole bunch of stuff that 's money good and a whole bunch of stuff that 's not so good 
 analysts at standard & poor 's say junk bond offerings by tightly stretched issuers seem to be growing 
 almost $ N billion of junk bonds that are considered UUUNKKK include issues from sci tv gillette holdings not related to gillette co. UUUNKKK UUUNKKK furniture allied stores federated department stores national UUUNKKK UUUNKKK holdings UUUNKKK leaseway transportation and price communications 
 you could still have some very bad times ahead said mr. UUUNKKK 
 it 's possible to have a N N default rate in one year because we 're already seeing big problems in the midst of a pretty strong economy 
 i 'm certainly not comfortable saying we 've seen the bottom 
 but yesterday 's rally among good junk was a badly needed UUUNKKK for the market 
 many issues bounced off the floor mr. UUUNKKK said and benchmark junk issues recovered all of their losses from friday and early yesterday 
 in contrast he says the stock market gained back only about half what it lost friday and the government bond market lost about half what it gained friday 
 traders said yesterday 's rally was fueled by insurance companies looking for bargains after a drastic slide in prices the past month 
 in addition mutual funds did n't appear to be major sellers of high-yield securities as was expected 
 sometimes a UUUNKKK is healthy said drexel 's mr. UUUNKKK 
 people will learn to be more UUUNKKK 
 if they do good credit analysis they will avoid the hand UUUNKKK 
 i think the market is in good shape 
 should you really own stocks 
 that 's a question a lot of people are asking following the stock market 's stunning display of volatility 
 UUUNKKK financially and UUUNKKK by friday 's UUUNKKK 190-point drop in the dow jones industrial average and yesterday 's UUUNKKK rebound they 're wondering if an individual has any business being in the market 
 the answer say academic researchers money managers and investment specialists is yes as long as you approach the stock market as an investor 
 but they say people should n't try to be traders who buy and sell in an effort to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock 
 the case for owning stocks over the long-term is compelling 
 if you look at N years worth of investment history including the great depression and every bear market since stocks have outperformed almost everything an individual could have owned by a long shot says barry berlin vice president at first wachovia capital management 
 a dollar invested in the stock market in N would have grown to $ N by the end of last june according to laurence UUUNKKK managing director at UUUNKKK associates inc 
 but a dollar invested in long-term bonds in N would have grown to only $ N and a dollar put in treasury bills would equal a UUUNKKK $ N 
 the longer the time period the less risk there is of losing money in the stock market 
 over time the odds increasingly favor the investor with a diversified portfolio 
 for instance ken gregory a san francisco money manager UUUNKKK that if an investor holds a basket of stocks that tracks the standard & poor 's 500-stock index the chance of losing money is N N to N N over a 10-year period compared with N N over three years and N N over one year 
 if you do n't need the money for N years there 's a UUUNKKK case for sticking to a steady core of stocks mr. gregory says 
 stock-market investments also help balance the other assets an individual owns says john UUUNKKK jr. president of the institute of certified financial planners 
 stocks have a place in an investors ' portfolio along with real estate bonds international securities and cash he says 
 there are some important UUUNKKK before investing in stocks individuals should have at least three to six months of living expenses set aside in the bank most investment advisers say 
 individuals also should focus on building equity in a home which provides some protection against inflation as well as a UUUNKKK that can be UUUNKKK in late in life to help cover the cost of retirement living 
 people also should n't invest money in stocks that they 'll need in the near future for example for college tuition payments or retirement expenses 
 you may have to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge says mr. UUUNKKK a del UUUNKKK calif. financial planner 
 but once the UUUNKKK are covered then i would start to invest even if it 's as little as $ N says michael lipper president of lipper analytical services inc 
 he says individuals should consider not just stocks but other long-term investments such as high-quality bonds 
 despite the strong case for stocks however most pros warn that individuals should n't try to profit from short-term developments 
 it 's very difficult to do says donald holt a market strategist for UUUNKKK morgan securities a los angeles brokerage firm 
 our markets move so fast and they are so volatile there 's no way the average investor can compete with the pros 
 individual investors face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market 
 the cost of executing stock orders UUUNKKK from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order but N N of the order 's value is an average says stephen boesel manager of t. rowe price 's growth and income mutual fund 
 and assuming their first investment is successful investors will have to pay taxes on their gains 
 that can reduce returns by a third or more once local taxes are included mr. lipper says 
 after that individual traders face the risk that the new investment they choose wo n't perform well so their trading costs could be sustained for nothing 
 it 's very tough for most individuals to UUUNKKK the mutual funds or the market says mr. lipper 
 you should really think twice if you think you can UUUNKKK the system 
 then too many individual investors lack the UUUNKKK emotional makeup professionals say is needed to plunge in and out of the market 
 so what 's the best way to buy stocks 
 unless an individual has a minimum of between $ N and $ N to invest in stocks he 's still better off in mutual funds than in individual stocks in terms of getting enough attention from a competent broker says mr. lipper 
 still he adds i could see owning both given that individuals often have an advantage over big investors in UUUNKKK special situations based on their own UUUNKKK he adds 
 george douglas first vice president at drexel burnham lambert inc. says that individuals have a particular edge now in small to UUUNKKK niche companies with exciting earnings prospects a traditional UUUNKKK ground for small investors 
 this growth sector which usually carries a UUUNKKK multiple about twice that of the standard & poor 's N happens to include some of the market 's most attractive bargains right now 
 it 's now selling at a multiple about even with the market says mr. douglas 
 moreover mr. douglas sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term 
 many big wall street brokerage firms who eliminated their research effort in stocks of emerging growth companies a few years ago are now UUUNKKK coverage of this area he notes 
 we 're seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth stocks he says 
 the pros UUUNKKK advise individuals to stay away from the latest investment fad 
 they say that 's especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle when there 's no robust bull market to bail investors out of their mistakes 
 friday 's correction presents a pretty good buying opportunity but let 's not speculate at this point in the business cycle says UUUNKKK UUUNKKK chief equity portfolio strategist at first boston corp 
 buy stocks on weakness for their long-term fundamentals he says 
 in the long run investment advisers say most investors will be better off using the UUUNKKK averaging method of buying stocks 
 in this method a person invests a regular amount every month or quarter into the stock market whether the market is up or down 
 that cuts the risk mr. gregory the san francisco money manager points out 
 when the market is low you are buying more shares and when it 's high you 're buying fewer shares he says 
 otherwise if you put all your money in at one time by sheer bad luck you might pick a terrible time and have to wait three years to get even mr. gregory says 
 a disciplined program will work the best mr. boesel says 
 one of the hardest things to do is to buy stocks when the market is down he says 
 but that 's just the time when you should be buying them

 donald trump who faced rising doubt about his bid for american airlines parent amr corp. even before a united airlines buy-out came apart friday withdrew his $ N billion offer 
 separately bankers representing the group trying to buy united 's parent ual corp. met with other banks about UUUNKKK that purchase at a lower price possibly around $ N a share or $ N billion 
 but a lower bid could face rejection by the ual board 
 mr. trump who vowed wednesday to go forward with the bid said he was dropping it in light of the recent change in market conditions 
 he said he might now sell his amr stake buy more shares or make another offer at a lower price 
 the manhattan real-estate developer acted after the ual buyers failed to obtain financing for their earlier $ 300-a-share bid which sparked a selling panic among that UUUNKKK into a 190-point drop friday in the dow jones industrial average 
 news about ual and amr whose shares never reopened after trading was halted friday for the ual announcement sent both stocks UUUNKKK in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 ual tumbled $ N to $ N on volume of N million shares and amr declined by $ N to $ N as N million shares changed hands 
 together the two stocks UUUNKKK havoc among takeover stock traders and caused a N N drop in the dow jones transportation average second in size only to the stock-market crash of oct. N N 
 some said friday 's market debacle had given mr. trump an excuse to bail out of an offer that showed signs of UUUNKKK even before problems emerged with the ual deal 
 after reaching an intraday high of $ N the day mr. trump disclosed his bid oct. N amr 's stock had retreated as low as $ N last week 
 some takeover stock traders had been betting against mr. trump because he has a record of disclosing stakes in companies that are potential takeover targets then selling at a profit without making a bid 
 he still has n't proven his UUUNKKK as a UUUNKKK UUUNKKK artist said airline analyst kevin murphy of morgan stanley & co 
 he 's done this thing where he 'll buy a little bit of a company and then trade out of it 
 he 's written this book the art of the deal 
 why does n't he just follow through on one of these things 
 mr. trump withdrew his bid before the amr board which is due to meet tomorrow ever formally considered it 
 amr had weighed a wide range of possible responses from flat rejection to UUUNKKK and leveraged buy-outs that might have included either employees a UUUNKKK buyer such as texas billionaire robert bass or both 
 amr had also sought to UUUNKKK mr. trump in congress by lobbying for legislation that would have bolstered the authority of the transportation department to reject airline buy-outs 
 yesterday mr. trump tried to put the blame for the collapse of the ual deal on congress saying it was rushing through a bill to protect amr executives 
 i believe that the perception that legislation in this area may be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the ual transaction and the resulting disruption in the financial markets experienced this past friday mr. trump wrote members of congress 
 amr declined to comment and mr. trump did n't respond to requests for interviews 
 mr. trump never said how much amr stock he had bought only that his holdings were substantial 
 however he only received federal clearance to buy more than $ N million of the stock on sept. N when the price rose $ N a share to $ N 
 between then and his bid on oct. N the price UUUNKKK between $ N and $ N 
 in an attempt to persuade investors that his bid was n't just a stock play mr. trump promised last week to notify the market before selling any shares 
 amr was trading at around $ N yesterday before his withdrawal announcement then immediately fell to about $ N 
 assuming that he paid a rough average price of $ N a share and assuming he did n't sell before his announcement reached the market mr. trump could be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at $ N 
 some analysts said amr chairman robert crandall might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the nation 's largest airline with a defensive transaction such as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees 
 however other knowledgeable observers said they believed mr. crandall and the amr board might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps 
 some analysts said they believed mr. trump whose UUUNKKK UUUNKKK had been viewed by some as a reason to believe he would n't back out might come back with a lower bid 
 ray UUUNKKK of dillon read & co. said mr. trump is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle 
 i 'm sure he still wants amr 
 but others remained skeptical 
 i was never sure donald trump really wanted to take amr said john UUUNKKK a bond analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc 
 what happened with united was a UUUNKKK way for him to UUUNKKK out 
 mr. trump never obtained financing for his bid 
 that skepticism would leave him with an even greater credibility problem should he return that would UUUNKKK him in any effort to oust the board in a proxy fight 
 meanwhile citicorp and chase manhattan corp. the two lead lenders on the ual buy-out met with other banks yesterday to determine if they would be willing to finance the buy-out at a lower price 
 officials familiar with the talks said citicorp had discussed lowering the offer to $ N a share but said that price was a talking point and that no decision has been made 
 at $ N a share the group would have to borrow about $ N billion from banks 
 the first ual deal unraveled after citibank and chase could n't raise $ N billion 
 citibank and chase had agreed to commit $ N billion and said they were highly confident of raising another $ N billion 
 together citicorp and chase received $ N million in fees to raise the rest of the financing 
 but other banks balked at the low interest rate and banking fees the ual group was willing to pay them 
 officials familiar with the bank talks said the ual buy-out group ual pilots management and british airways plc is now willing to pay higher bank fees and interest but is n't likely to boost its $ N million equity contribution 
 nor is the group likely to come forward with a revised offer within the next N hours despite the hopes of many traders 
 the group 's advisers want to make certain they have firm bank commitments the second time around 
 even if the buy-out group is able to obtain financing the transaction still faces obstacles 
 ual 's board could reject the new price as too low especially since there are n't any competing bids 
 los angeles investor marvin davis whose $ UUUNKKK offer was rejected by ual 's board has n't shown signs of pursuing a $ 300-a-share UUUNKKK bid he made last month 
 in addition the coalition of labor and management longtime enemies who joined forces only under the threat of mr. davis 's bid could break apart now 
 the group 's resilience gets its first test today when N top pilot union leaders UUUNKKK outside chicago in a previously scheduled meeting 
 union chairman UUUNKKK rick UUUNKKK faces the tough task of explaining why banks refused to finance a buy-out the members approved UUUNKKK last week 
 the pilot union is UUUNKKK to pursue an acquisition whatever the board decides 
 but if the board UUUNKKK a reduced bid and decides to explore other alternatives it could transform what has been a UUUNKKK process into an UUUNKKK one 
 the pilots could play UUUNKKK by noting they are crucial to any sale or restructuring because they can refuse to fly the airplanes 
 if they were to insist on a low bid of say $ N a share the board might n't be able to obtain a higher offer from other bidders because banks might hesitate to finance a transaction the pilots oppose 
 also because ual chairman stephen wolf and other ual executives have joined the pilots ' bid the board might be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other bidders 
 that could cost him the chance to influence the outcome and perhaps join the winning bidder 
 influential members of the house ways and means committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts 
 the bill whose backers include chairman dan UUUNKKK d. ill. would prevent the resolution trust corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an UUUNKKK bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget 
 the bill intends to restrict the rtc to treasury borrowings only unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization 
 such agency UUUNKKK borrowing is unauthorized and expensive far more expensive than direct treasury borrowing said rep. UUUNKKK stark d. calif. the bill 's chief sponsor 
 the complex financing plan in the s&l bailout law includes raising $ N billion from debt issued by the newly created rtc 
 this financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit 
 another $ N billion would be raised through treasury bonds which pay lower interest rates 
 but the rtc also requires working capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold until the assets can be sold separately 
 that debt would be paid off as the assets are sold leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ N billion or $ N billion including interest over N years 
 it 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved said david UUUNKKK executive director of the rtc 
 the agency has already spent roughly $ N billion selling N insolvent s&ls and it is likely to sell or merge N by the time the bailout concludes 
 UUUNKKK other working capital he said the rtc would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets 
 we would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward he said 
 the complicated language in the huge new law has UUUNKKK the fight 
 the law does allow the rtc to borrow from the treasury up to $ N billion at any time 
 moreover it says the rtc 's total obligations may not exceed $ N billion but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt and UUUNKKK from it the market value of the assets the rtc holds 
 but congress did n't anticipate or intend more public debt say opponents of the rtc 's UUUNKKK plan and rep. charles UUUNKKK d. n.y said the rtc oversight board has been UUUNKKK in not keeping congress informed 
 that UUUNKKK leads to a proposal like the one from ways and means which seems to me sort of UUUNKKK he said 
 the rtc is going to have to pay a price of prior UUUNKKK on the hill if they want that kind of flexibility 
 the ways and means committee will hold a hearing on the bill next tuesday 
 we 're about to see if advertising works 
 hard on the heels of friday 's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads UUUNKKK a familiar message keep on investing the market 's just fine 
 their mission is to keep clients from UUUNKKK the market as individual investors did in UUUNKKK after the crash in october 
 just days after the N crash major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors 
 this time around they 're moving even faster 
 painewebber inc. UUUNKKK a new television commercial at N p.m. edt yesterday and had it on the air by last night 
 fidelity investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday and wrote another new ad appearing today 
 shearson lehman hutton inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new tv ads 
 it considered running them during tomorrow night 's world series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday 
 other brokerage firms including merrill lynch & co. were UUUNKKK out potential new ad strategies 
 the brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic 
 this time the firms were ready 
 fidelity for example prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge 
 when the market went into its free fall friday afternoon the investment firm ordered full pages in the monday editions of half a dozen newspapers 
 the ads touted fidelity 's automated UUUNKKK beneath the huge headline fidelity is ready for your call 
 a fidelity spokesman says the UUUNKKK which already was operating but which many clients did n't know about received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend 
 a lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us he says 
 to maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial 
 it would have been too late to think about on friday 
 we had to think about it ahead of time 
 today 's fidelity ad goes a step further encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with fidelity 
 UUUNKKK the headline diversification it UUUNKKK based on the events of the past week all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market 's volatility 
 it goes on to plug a few diversified fidelity funds by name 
 painewebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the N crash 
 in the aftermath of the N debacle the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night 
 it also negotiated an arrangement with cable news network under which UUUNKKK would agree to air its last-minute UUUNKKK 
 the new painewebber commercial created with ad agency saatchi & saatchi co. features mary farrell one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists UUUNKKK particularly bullish 
 taped just as the market closed yesterday it offers ms. farrell advising we view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle 
 we continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation 
 the spot was scheduled to appear three times on UUUNKKK last night 
 painewebber considered an even harder sell recommending specific stocks 
 instead it settled on just urging the clients who are its UUUNKKK to keep that money in the market 
 we 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything which just drives the prices down further says john UUUNKKK painewebber 's director of advertising 
 if you owned it and liked it friday the true value has n't changed 
 he adds this is n't N UUUNKKK 
 with the market UUUNKKK and then closing up more than N points yesterday investment firms had to constantly revise their approach 
 at shearson lehman executives created potential new commercials friday night and throughout the weekend then had to UUUNKKK yesterday afternoon 
 the plan had been to make one of shearson 's UUUNKKK black-and-white where we stand commercials which have been running occasionally in response to news events since N 
 the ad would have run during the world series tomorrow replacing the debut commercial of shearson 's new ad campaign leadership by example 
 but in a meeting after the market closed yesterday shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad 
 we do n't think at this point anything needs to be said 
 the market seems to be UUUNKKK out we 're taking a UUUNKKK attitude says UUUNKKK b. stewart executive vice president of marketing 
 in any case the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of N 
 but it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective 
 in N despite a UUUNKKK of ads from most of the major investment firms individuals ran from the market en UUUNKKK 
 now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around

 the magazine will distribute N N of the gross revenues from the supplement as grants to innovative teachers

 baseball that game of the long haul is the UUUNKKK sport of the mean and the mean UUUNKKK law caught up with the san francisco giants in the world series last weekend 
 the team that dumped runs by the bushel on the chicago cubs in the national league playoffs was held to just one in two games by the UUUNKKK oakland a 's the gang that had been done UUUNKKK similarly by the los angeles UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK UUUNKKK in last year 's UUUNKKK 
 UUUNKKK much of the damage was accomplished by a 's who had some catching up to do 
 in game two on a cool sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn a lot of the catching up was done by the a 's UUUNKKK terry UUUNKKK 
 he hit a N pitch from rick UUUNKKK into the UUUNKKK stands in inning four to stretch his team 's lead from N to a decisive N where it stayed 
 so what if UUUNKKK had struck just seven home runs in N regular-season games and UUUNKKK in the seventh position of the a 's lineup 
 if you get your pitch and take a good swing anything can happen he later UUUNKKK 
 on saturday night quite a few of the boys in green and gold UUUNKKK away successes to UUUNKKK the pain of past and no doubt future UUUNKKK 
 mark UUUNKKK the big UUUNKKK oakland first UUUNKKK had three hits in four at UUUNKKK two more than he 'd had in the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK series in which he 'd gone UUUNKKK 
 the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK N through N UUUNKKK the bottom of the order got seven of their team 's N hits and scored four of its runs in a N decision 
 UUUNKKK dave stewart held the giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the saturday UUUNKKK 
 that he was the a 's UUUNKKK UUUNKKK during its american league campaign with a N mark plus two wins over toronto in the playoffs indicates he may have some evening up coming but with the way his UUUNKKK UUUNKKK is UUUNKKK that might not be this week 
 the same goes for mike moore another veteran who UUUNKKK early struggles to permit the giants but a run and four hits in seven UUUNKKK in sunday 's contest 
 every guy they put out there had a better UUUNKKK than the guy before UUUNKKK giant manager roger craig 
 he 's an UUUNKKK who 's one of the leading UUUNKKK of the fashionable delivery which looks like a UUUNKKK until it UUUNKKK beneath the UUUNKKK bat 
 the UUUNKKK of the UUUNKKK is that the a 's go into san francisco 's candlestick park tonight up two games to none in the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 the UUUNKKK to UUUNKKK with here says that about three of four clubs N of N that took N series leads went on to win it all 
 that 's not an average to UUUNKKK giant UUUNKKK 
 one might think that the home fans in this series of the subway called bart that 's a better name for a public UUUNKKK than desire do n't you think would have been UUUNKKK over the proceedings but they UUUNKKK them in relative calm 
 UUUNKKK of the two UUUNKKK sat side by side in the UUUNKKK seats of oakland UUUNKKK and while they cheered their UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK the opposition UUUNKKK advanced no further at least as far as i could see 
 a few folks even showed up wearing UUUNKKK bearing the colors and UUUNKKK of both teams 
 i 'm for the giants today but only because they lost yesterday 
 i love UUUNKKK both 
 the only thing i 'm UUUNKKK for is for the series to go seven games said david williams a sacramento UUUNKKK at the UUUNKKK before sunday 's go 
 the above represents a UUUNKKK of either UUUNKKK or UUUNKKK 
 i choose to believe it 's the latter although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here including the a 's and giants is originally from somewhere else 
 UUUNKKK it to say that if this were a new york UUUNKKK series or one between the chicago cubs and white UUUNKKK UUUNKKK it 's possible you 'd need UUUNKKK police in every other seat to separate opposing fans and only the UUUNKKK would UUUNKKK their UUUNKKK 
 anyway the a 's gave you a lot of heroes to root for 
 in the opening game besides UUUNKKK and stewart there was walt weiss a UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK who had lost a couple months of the season to UUUNKKK surgery 
 he was UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK in game two moved a UUUNKKK along in the a 's UUUNKKK second inning and UUUNKKK for his team 's final tally 
 such is his reputation among the east bay UUUNKKK that when he hit his first career home run last season the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an UUUNKKK 
 not his UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 's 
 an a 's UUUNKKK of the second game was UUUNKKK henderson who UUUNKKK the hot side of the UUUNKKK equation 
 he UUUNKKK toronto in the playoffs with six hits seven walks and eight stolen bases in N at UUUNKKK and continued that by going UUUNKKK at the plate sunday along with walking stealing a base and scoring a run 
 when you 're in the UUUNKKK you see every ball UUUNKKK he UUUNKKK 
 the cold guys in the set were will clark kevin mitchell and UUUNKKK williams the giants ' N UUUNKKK 
 they combined for N hits six home runs and N runs UUUNKKK in in the five games against the cubs 
 they went a collective UUUNKKK here with zero UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK 
 it 's that last set of numbers as much as anything else that gives the giants hope in the series games to come 
 i believe in the law of averages declared san francisco UUUNKKK coach dusty baker after game two 
 i 'd rather see a UUUNKKK UUUNKKK who 's hot come up for the other side than a good UUUNKKK who 's cold 
 but the old UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side 
 when it goes you never know when you 'll get it back he said 
 that 's baseball 
 ncr corp. reported a N N drop in third-quarter net income citing intense competition that caused its gross profit margins to dip 
 net income for the quarter fell to $ N million from $ N million roughly what analysts had expected 
 but per-share profit dropped only N N to $ N a share from $ N a share as the company continued its stock buy-back plan 
 average shares outstanding dropped to N million from N million 
 revenue fell N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 the computer maker which sells more than half its goods outside the u.s. also said the negative effect of a stronger u.s. dollar will UUUNKKK affect its fourth-quarter performance and make it difficult to better N results 
 ncr said revenue declined both in the u.s. and overseas reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets 
 the company however said orders in the u.s. showed good gains during the latest quarter 
 analysts estimate those gains at N N to N N a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of ncr 's major customers 
 in addition to a general slowing of the computer industry ncr which sells automated teller machines and computerized cash UUUNKKK is also affected by the retail and financial sectors areas of the economy that have generally not been robust notes UUUNKKK g. UUUNKKK an analyst for salomon brothers inc 
 these factors combined with a strong dollar should UUUNKKK affect the current quarter 's results ncr said 
 in the year-earlier fourth quarter ncr had profit of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N billion 
 mr. UUUNKKK said he lowered his full-year estimates for N to $ N a share from $ N a share 
 revenue projections were slashed to $ N billion from $ N billion

 concerning your sept. N article wall street firms link analysts ' pay to performance i 'm UUUNKKK that wall street is finally UUUNKKK in to the hard cold facts of the real working world 
 if the firms are serious however why limit the practice to the poor UUUNKKK analysts whose ability to see into the future is fragile at best 
 why not extend the same harsh standards to the sales force and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based on how much money they made for their clients during the year 
 that should stop a lot of UUUNKKK and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern careful thought and good sense 
 now would n't that be a UUUNKKK

 for many of london 's securities traders it was a day that started nervously in the small hours 
 by UUUNKKK the selling was at UUUNKKK fever 
 but as the day ended in a UUUNKKK wall UUUNKKK rally the city UUUNKKK a sigh of relief 
 so it went yesterday in the trading rooms of london 's financial district 
 in the wake of wall street 's plunge last friday the london market was considered especially vulnerable 
 and before the opening of trading here yesterday all eyes were on early trading in tokyo for a clue as to how widespread the fallout might be 
 by the time trading officially got under way at N a.m. the news from asia was in 
 and it left mixed signals for london 
 tokyo stocks closed off a significant but UUUNKKK N N on thin volume hong kong stocks declined N N in orderly trading 
 at jefferies ' trading room on UUUNKKK circus a UUUNKKK circle at the edge of the financial district desktop computer screens displayed the london market 's major barometer the financial times-stock exchange N share index 
 red figures on the screens indicated falling stocks blue figures rising stocks 
 right away the UUUNKKK outnumbered the blues N to N as the index opened at N off N points or N N 
 i see concern but i do n't see any panic said mr. UUUNKKK a big UUUNKKK new york native who runs the UUUNKKK office 
 the jefferies office a branch of the los angeles-based firm played it UUUNKKK seeking to avoid risk 
 this is not the sort of market to have a big position in said david smith who heads trading in all non-u.s. stocks 
 we tend to run a very tight book 
 jefferies spent most of its UUUNKKK in the morning trying to match buyers and sellers and there were n't many buyers 
 all the takeover stocks scottish & UUUNKKK b.a.t UUUNKKK are getting pretty well UUUNKKK this morning mr. smith said 
 seconds later a UUUNKKK sell order for scottish & UUUNKKK came in 
 for the third time in N minutes a trader next to mr. smith left the UUUNKKK area to have a cigarette 
 on the screens only two UUUNKKK blue figures remained but the index had recovered a few points and was off about N 
 because tokyo did n't collapse let 's pick up a little stock mr. smith said 
 he targeted N shares of reuters and UUUNKKK a UUUNKKK to call up on his screen other dealers ' price quotes 
 the vivid yellow figures showed the best price at N pence $ N and mr. smith 's traders started putting out UUUNKKK 
 but the market UUUNKKK a serious buyer on a day dominated by selling and the quotes immediately jumped to N pence 
 when i want to buy they run from you they keep changing their prices mr. smith said 
 it 's very frustrating 
 he temporarily abandoned his search for the reuters shares 
 by this time it was N a.m. in new york and mr. smith UUUNKKK a call from a new york customer wanting an opinion on the british stock market which had been having troubles of its own even before friday 's new york market break 
 fundamentally dangerous mr. smith said almost in a UUUNKKK fundamentally weak fairly vulnerable still extremely UUUNKKK poised 
 we 're in for a lot of turbulence 
 he was right 
 by midday the london market was in full retreat 
 it 's falling like a stone said danny UUUNKKK a pit trader who was standing outside the london international financial futures exchange 
 only half the usual UUUNKKK crowd gathered at the tony UUUNKKK & UUUNKKK wine bar on old broad street nearby

 the house aviation subcommittee approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major u.s. airlines 
 the collapsed plan to acquire ual corp. parent of united airlines spurred quick action on the legislation introduced wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday 
 the bill is expected to be taken up by the public works and transportation committee tomorrow and a floor vote by next week will be urged 
 the measure drew criticism from the bush administration and a UUUNKKK shot from financier donald trump who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for amr corp. the parent of american airlines 
 in a letter to subcommittee chairman james UUUNKKK d. minn. mr. trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for amr and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal 
 UUUNKKK UUUNKKK deputy transportation secretary also sent a letter to express the administration 's opposition to the bill in its present form 
 rep. UUUNKKK brushed off mr. trump 's allegations as an excuse for his own deal failing 
 he also said the fact that the other letter had n't come from transportation secretary samuel skinner indicated there is UUUNKKK room in the administration 's position 
 mr. UUUNKKK and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation 
 but they cited the ual and amr examples as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation 
 aides both in the house and senate said the withdrawal of the trump bid for amr is n't likely to UUUNKKK efforts to push the legislation 
 it 's still on the fast track and we still want to do it said one senate aide 
 the bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy-out 
 currently the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers but can take the drastic step of UUUNKKK the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers UUUNKKK 
 supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and UUUNKKK to the UUUNKKK process and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry 
 in general the bill would give the transportation department a 30-day review period before N N or more of the voting stock of a major u.s. air carrier could be acquired 
 it also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition 
 the bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets or give control to a foreign interest 
 if more information is needed the secretary would have authority to extend the review period N days 
 all the witnesses both congressmen and industry experts expressed support for the bill in order to prevent UUUNKKK from UUUNKKK in on airline profits at the expense of safe UUUNKKK service 
 but several committee members UUUNKKK some backing mr. trump 's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the ual deal and the stock-market plunge 
 one of the major concerns expressed by the UUUNKKK was that large airlines would be prohibited from UUUNKKK themselves of smaller entities and producing independent UUUNKKK companies 
 in a possible prelude to the UUUNKKK of talks between boeing co. and striking machinists union members a federal mediator said representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow 
 it could be a long meeting or it could be a short one said doug hammond the mediator who called the agreement to meet a first step toward a UUUNKKK of negotiations 
 we 're encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that we have made no expression of expectations a boeing spokesman said 
 the machinists union has rejected a three-year contract offer that would have provided a N N wage increase over the life of the pact plus some bonuses 
 currently average pay for machinists is $ N an hour boeing said 
 now in its 13th day the strike has UUUNKKK about N machinists and has started to delay delivery of some UUUNKKK 
 with a strike fund of about $ N million the union had said it was prepared for a long strike 
 after the third week on strike union members will begin receiving $ N a week from the fund 
 work at boeing continues with supervisors and other UUUNKKK personnel UUUNKKK the lines 
 and at the company 's wichita kan. plant about N of the N machinists still are working boeing said

 dpc acquisition partners a hostile suitor for dataproducts corp. said it intends to launch a tender offer for the computer printer maker 's common stock 
 dpc a group led by the new york investment firm UUUNKKK inc. also said it plans to file preliminary materials with the securities and exchange commission regarding a shareholder solicitation to oust dataproducts ' board

 as part of the plan dataproducts announced a pact to sell $ N million of its real estate holdings to UUUNKKK properties inc. a unit of canada 's UUUNKKK corp

 share prices plummeted across europe yesterday in response to friday 's new york sell-off but some issues staged a late comeback after wall street opened without another rout

 the index closed at N down N points 
 by comparison two years ago on black monday the new index would have dropped N N according to a projection by the exchange 
 investors may have reacted so strongly to friday 's u.s. stock market loss because they had vivid memories of the frankfurt exchange 's losing N N of its value in the N crash and its wake 
 this time however many small investors may have been hurt by acting so swiftly 
 they all went in the wrong direction said andreas UUUNKKK an investment adviser for the bank in UUUNKKK 's frankfurt branch 
 he said he told clients to buy selected west german blue chips after they fell by about N N 
 after the opening was delayed N minutes because of the crush of sell orders frankfurt 's normal UUUNKKK trading session was extended N minutes to handle the heavy volume 
 the beginning was chaotic said nigel UUUNKKK a broker for commerzbank ag 
 it took UUUNKKK of an hour before enough prices could be worked out to get a reading on the market 
 institutional investors and bankers many of whom spent the night before in their offices watching far eastern markets were cautiously optimistic after the mild N N decline in tokyo stock prices 
 everybody was still confident including most institutional investors 
 that is why everybody was a little surprised by the storm of sell orders from small private investors said UUUNKKK UUUNKKK a senior trader for UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 some big institutions including banks began picking up UUUNKKK shares late yesterday but most investors wanted to see what would happen in new york before acting 
 but even if wall street continues to stabilize analysts here say the latest blow to investor confidence could inhibit a swift recovery for the frankfurt exchange which already was showing signs of weakness after the dax had slipped from a N high of N on sept. N 
 some of west germany 's UUUNKKK chips took some of the biggest hits 
 a N N drop for UUUNKKK ag and dresdner bank ag 's N N decline were especially UUUNKKK for their respective boards whose plans for major rights issues in november could now be in jeopardy 
 dresdner bank last month said it hoped to raise N billion marks $ N million by issuing four million shares at N marks each 
 yet yesterday 's market UUUNKKK dresdner 's share price by N marks to N marks a share leaving little incentive for investors to subscribe to the standing price unless the market UUUNKKK quickly

 the financial times-stock exchange N share index closed off N points at N its high for the day after having plunged N points at N p.m 
 it was big institutions such as UUUNKKK union insurance group scottish amicable investment managers and standard life assurance co. that UUUNKKK the rally

 volume was N million shares more than triple recent levels 
 paris 
 late buying gave the paris UUUNKKK a UUUNKKK after its free fall early in the day 
 the UUUNKKK general index ended down N N at N a drop of N points from friday 
 there was a volatility in the market that i have never seen before said UUUNKKK UUUNKKK a partner in brokerage firm UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 when wall street turned around shortly after the opening there was panic buying in paris 
 brokers said that as the news spread that wall street was moving up traders who had called to place sell orders changed their line in UUUNKKK ordering buys instead 
 trading was driven primarily by small investors and speculators with large institutions waiting on the sidelines until late in the day 
 when wall street turned however the big boys entered the market looking for bargains 
 j.p. morgan & co. swung to a loss in the third quarter while ncnb corp. reported net income more than doubled and security pacific corp. net rose N N 
 j.p. morgan & co 
 j.p. morgan as expected posted a $ N billion net loss for the quarter reflecting the new york bank 's decision last month to add $ N billion to reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries 
 the reserve addition placed the parent of morgan guaranty trust co. among a few major u.s. banks that have covered nearly all their medium and long-term portfolios to less-developed countries with reserves 
 the latest quarter 's loss UUUNKKK $ N a share 
 in the year-earlier quarter morgan earned $ N million or $ N a share 
 george m. UUUNKKK analyst at prudential-bache securities inc. called the results mildly disappointing 
 excluding the $ N billion provision and allowing for the taxes morgan paid earnings were about N cents a share mr. UUUNKKK said 
 in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday morgan climbed $ N a share to $ N 
 net interest income sank N N in the quarter to $ N million from $ N million 
 the interest rate on short-term funds which banks borrow to finance longer-term loans to customers was sharply higher morgan said 
 morgan received $ N million of interest payments on its medium and long-term brazilian loans had they been UUUNKKK interest net interest income would have been $ N million higher in the quarter morgan said 
 such loans to argentina also remain classified as UUUNKKK costing the bank $ N million of interest income in the third period 
 income from sources other than interest climbed N N to $ N million reflecting higher UUUNKKK and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities 
 these increases were partly offset by lower UUUNKKK income the bank said 
 non-interest expenses grew N N to $ N million 
 ncnb corp 
 ncnb corp. 's net income more than doubled in the period largely because of continued strong performance by the bank 's texas operations 
 the charlotte n.c. company said earnings rose to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 the latest quarter included a gain of $ N million or N cents a share related to the purchase of the remaining N N of ncnb texas national bank from the federal deposit insurance corp 
 the strong performance however UUUNKKK with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of ncnb 's problem loans particularly in the southeast 
 in the third quarter nonperforming assets jumped to $ N million or N N of net loans and leases from $ N million or N N in the second quarter 
 UUUNKKK totaled $ N million or N N in the year-ago third quarter 
 included in the increase in the most recent quarter is a $ N million loan which ncnb said it expects to be fully repaid with no loss early in the fourth quarter 
 the deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of N N in ncnb 's southeast operations as well as a N N growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign 
 the higher rates paid on deposits also helped squeeze ncnb 's net interest margin in the southeast to N N from N N a year earlier 
 in big board composite trading yesterday ncnb jumped $ N a share to $ N 
 results were released after the market closed 
 ncnb texas national formed from the UUUNKKK of of the failed first UUUNKKK corp. of dallas contributed $ N million to ncnb 's bottom line in the third quarter 
 ncnb said its third-quarter results reflect N N of earnings of the texas operation since aug. N 
 ncnb raised some $ N billion in new capital during the quarter to complete the ncnb texas purchase and to acquire several small failed thrifts to fill out its regional franchise 
 last week the banking company said it purchased both freedom savings & loan association tampa fla. and university federal savings association of san antonio texas for $ N million 
 in the first nine months ncnb 's net income climbed N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier 
 security pacific corp 
 security pacific 's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter but the los angeles bank holding company was still able to post a N N increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans 
 net rose to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier 
 the company said the gain resulted mainly from a $ N million increase in net interest income reflecting a N N increase in real estate loans mainly residential and a N N rise in consumer loans 
 these UUUNKKK loans in effect replaced some UUUNKKK assets such as UUUNKKK loans which were allowed to decrease 
 as a result security pacific 's net interest margin fell only N basis points a more mild decrease than some major banks outside california which have been reporting more sluggish earnings 
 security pacific shares closed at $ N down N cents in big board composite trading 
 the earnings represent a N N return on assets for security pacific and an N N return on equity 
 the loan growth offset continuing real-estate loan losses in the depressed arizona market 
 security pacific reported a N N increase in net credit losses for the quarter to $ N million from $ N million in the year-ago period 
 nonperforming loans grew slightly to $ N billion at sept. N from $ N billion a year ago 
 security pacific 's loan-loss provision was down N N or $ N million because it added to its UUUNKKK reserve the year before 
 non-interest income fell N N in the quarter mainly because of an unusual gain a year earlier from the sale of hong kong banking operations 
 non-interest expense grew only N N in the period 
 for the nine months net rose N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier 
 lin broadcasting corp. said it wo n't take a position on a revised tender offer by mccaw cellular communications inc. to buy lin and has asked for UUUNKKK of the offer 
 the new offer which seeks N N of the cellular and broadcasting concern is for $ N a share for N million lin shares 
 mccaw 's revised tender offer would require mccaw to begin an auction process in july N that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of lin 
 lin is asking mccaw to clarify its tender offer which challenges an agreement between bellsouth corp. and lin to merge their UUUNKKK businesses 
 bellsouth has notified lin that it would shortly respond to the mccaw proposal in as full and effective a manner as is UUUNKKK 
 the lin board said holders may be UUUNKKK by the provision in the mccaw proposal that guarantees private market value after five years for the remaining shares 
 mccaw has no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain the lin board said 
 the board added that mccaw would be able to control lin 's operations and could therefore operate lin in a manner which could UUUNKKK its private market value and UUUNKKK to a UUUNKKK UUUNKKK in five years 
 in national over-the-counter trading lin closed at $ N down $ N 
 a group of institutional investors in telerate inc. said that dow jones & co. 's $ UUUNKKK offer for the electronic financial information services company is grossly inadequate 
 in a letter filed with the securities and exchange commission the group which holds about N million telerate shares or about N N of the shares outstanding said at present none of us believes an offer for less than $ N per share would be fair and some believe that $ N is too low 
 the letter was dated oct. N 
 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange telerate shares closed yesterday at $ N down N cents a share 
 dow jones publisher of the wall street journal has launched an $ UUUNKKK or $ N million tender offer to acquire the remaining telerate shares outstanding dow jones owns N N of telerate

 the group includes UUUNKKK cos. and various affiliates based in boston wells fargo bank san francisco the california public employees retirement system sacramento calif. and t. rowe price associates inc. baltimore 
 among other issues the group 's letter said it has concerns as to whether dow jones 's offer meets the applicable requirements of procedural fairness 
 a spokesman for dow jones said he had n't seen the group 's filing but added obviously dow jones UUUNKKK with their conclusions 
 our offer is to buy any and all shares tendered at $ N a share 
 u.s. trade representative carla hills said the first UUUNKKK panel set up under the UUUNKKK free trade agreement has ruled that canada 's restrictions on exports of pacific UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK violate the accord 
 mrs. hills said the u.s. and canada have until nov. N to resolve the dispute 
 if a solution is n't reached by then she said the u.s. would have the right to suspend some trade concessions to canada equivalent in value to the losses suffered by u.s. UUUNKKK companies in alaska and the pacific northwest 
 however in UUUNKKK canadian trade minister john UUUNKKK said the UUUNKKK panel accepted the legitimacy of canada 's position on the use of these landing requirements to UUUNKKK and manage these important UUUNKKK 
 questioned about the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK in the u.s. and canadian government views of the panel 's report an aide for mrs. hills said the panel had clearly ruled that the canadian trade restrictions are illegal 
 the u.s. trade representative declined to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting from the canadian export restrictions 
 canada initially had an export prohibition that was replaced by regulations requiring that such fish had to be brought UUUNKKK in british columbia by commercial UUUNKKK prior to export 
 this action was defended by the canadian government on conservation grounds 
 mrs. hills said yesterday that the UUUNKKK panel rejected this canadian government argument 
 we fully expect that canada will comply with the panel 's ruling that the landing requirement also must be ended she said 
 earlier an international panel set up under the rules of the general agreement on tariffs and trade in geneva determined that the original canadian UUUNKKK restrictions violated gatt rules 
 mrs. hills said the u.s. wo n't accept any delays after nov. N because u.s. UUUNKKK firms enter into contracts in the fall to purchase the next season 's catch 
 she said the canadian restrictions must be removed before such contracts are concluded

 the market upheaval apparently has n't triggered any cash crunch yet 
 individual investors investment firms and arbitragers who speculate in the stocks of takeover candidates can suffer liquidity and payment problems when stocks dive those investors often borrow heavily to buy their holdings and use the stocks as collateral for loans

 we 're seeing nothing out of the ordinary said one official at a top N bank 
 that 's good news because we all UUUNKKK in this water 
 added another executive at a big bank we were all a little UUUNKKK over the weekend trying to forecast what would happen monday but it 's been very quiet 
 now as for tomorrow hell who knows 
 what happened friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently UUUNKKK to handle another UUUNKKK in prices 
 no UUUNKKK with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling 
 but markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency 
 after the N plunge markets agreed that it would be UUUNKKK to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose 
 the new york stock exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers if the dow jones index falls N points in a day the exchange will halt trading for one hour if the decline hits N points the exchange will close for an additional two hours 
 the rationale is that an UUUNKKK of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels 
 it is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic 
 a temporary UUUNKKK of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself 
 but there is also the possibility that UUUNKKK down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices 
 what happened friday was the worst of all UUUNKKK 
 the futures exchanges followed their own UUUNKKK circuit breakers and shut down at about N p.m. for N minutes after the standard & poor 's N stock index had fallen N points or about N points on the dow jones index 
 options markets stopped trading in many securities 
 the new york stock exchange under its own rules remained open 
 with nowhere else to go sellers and particularly program traders focused all their selling on the new york stock exchange 
 as liquidity on that market weakened prices fell sharply 
 had the futures and options markets been open additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline most probably would have been less intense 
 at N after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and washington the futures exchanges reopened 
 futures trading however was halted altogether at N after the futures markets had dropped an additional N points which is the daily limit for price declines 
 at this point the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the new york stock exchange 
 it is time to recognize that the new york stock exchange the futures markets and the options markets though UUUNKKK separate have actually become so closely UUUNKKK as to constitute one market effectively 
 traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them 
 it therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers 
 to achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility either all markets should be open to trading or none 
 UUUNKKK circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on friday but they probably would have made for UUUNKKK less volatile executions 
 it 's time for the exchanges and the securities and exchange commission to agree on joint conditions for UUUNKKK trading or staying open 
 let 's not have one market shut down for N minutes when the dow declines N points and another shut down for an hour after a UUUNKKK decline 
 the need for UUUNKKK last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that UUUNKKK circuit breakers in all markets 
 the new circuit breakers if they are to be applied at all will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the new york stock exchange remains open 
 the rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies 
 should the sec and the commodities futures trading commission which with the sec UUUNKKK the chicago stock-index markets be unable to agree the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the treasury secretary 
 in many ways our financial markets are better prepared today to handle a decline than they were two years ago 
 the new york stock exchange now has the capacity to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day 
 telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers and specialists who i believe should stay despite the UUUNKKK of some post-crash critics have larger capital positions 
 of course specialists ' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices 
 witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed early friday and opened late monday because of an excess of sell orders

 chicken chains UUUNKKK by loss of customers 
 fast-food chicken chains faced with a worsening business slump are struggling to hatch some new marketing strategies

 the continuing series of hud scandals is a UUUNKKK predictable result of pork-barrel politics 
 nevertheless UUUNKKK such as the national association of home builders nahb continue to pressure capitol hill for more special-interest spending 
 kent UUUNKKK nahb executive vice president argues that the u.s. faces a UUUNKKK housing crisis reduced UUUNKKK of homes for first-time buyers increased homelessness and lower apartment construction rates that will be very difficult to solve without expanded federal resources 
 there 's nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending 
 but the nahb was created in N out of an organization that made its name fighting a UUUNKKK administration proposal to take over all defense housing production 
 through the years the association has been an active member of the taxpayer 's coalition pushing for such initiatives as the UUUNKKK amendment 
 yet on matters close to UUUNKKK home 
 the hud budget has dropped by more than N N since N argues mr. UUUNKKK 
 we 've taken more than our fair share 
 i would n't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit 
 but nahb support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch over the years the nahb has backed a host of public programs 
 it once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has regularly advanced UUUNKKK housing measures 
 moreover explains one hud official the nahb remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that specialize in subsidized production 
 the association is pushing an extensive and expensive UUUNKKK which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $ N billion annually 
 direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved UUUNKKK expensive in the past and inevitably are UUUNKKK to the benefit of UUUNKKK developers and lobbyists as demonstrated by the ongoing hud scandal or congressmen 
 indirect subsidies through the fha for instance are little better 
 though mr. UUUNKKK says expanding fha lending would result in no cost to the government the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing such as low-income to the single-family home market would result in a major expense 
 more important housing programs run by hud the va and UUUNKKK are UUUNKKK in red ink 
 the fha alone lost $ N billion in fiscal N the government 's equity in the agency essentially its reserve fund fell to minus $ N billion 
 the federal government has had to pump in $ N billion into the va housing program since N to keep the fund afloat and the va requested an additional $ N million for the fiscal year just ended 
 all told the federal government already guarantees more than $ N billion of mortgages 
 in its UUUNKKK produced publication where will our children live the nahb does acknowledge that of course the full measure of housing UUUNKKK can not be provided by the federal government 
 it points to the UUUNKKK impact of local government regulation particularly UUUNKKK and building fees which UUUNKKK the price of housing out of the reach of UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK people 
 but while the nahb has suggested actions that states and UUUNKKK should take to reduce regulatory barriers the association has proposed no activist legislative program comparable to say its detailed request for more federal subsidies to eliminate UUUNKKK controls 
 the association a majority of whose N members build fewer than N units a year is like many other business UUUNKKK 
 explains UUUNKKK macdonald of the national taxpayers union it UUUNKKK in two UUUNKKK 
 the builders like the subsidies but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues such as the UUUNKKK amendment 
 unfortunately the organization 's desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility 
 two years ago when the nahb lobbied for the $ N billion omnibus housing bill the organization basically dropped out of the taxpayers ' coalition says ms. macdonald 
 as mr. UUUNKKK of the nahb acknowledges government is not going to solve the problem 
 the real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down 
 more money for hud will increase the deficit and UUUNKKK the economy more money to municipalities that are UUUNKKK their local housing markets will further UUUNKKK them from the UUUNKKK effects of their policies 
 is this what the home builders want

 in an attempt to give new momentum to european community plans for a single currency ec government leaders are likely to agree to set a date for starting formal talks on UUUNKKK the ec 's founding treaty of rome 
 according to diplomatic sources in brussels most ec leaders agree that talks should begin in the second half of N and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in UUUNKKK france on dec. N and N 
 the only strong opposition to changing the ec treaty comes from british prime minister margaret thatcher who is opposed to creating a single ec currency 
 but the process of UUUNKKK the UUUNKKK conference does n't require UUUNKKK 
 setting a date to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself but could be viewed as an important psychological push 
 french president UUUNKKK mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the ec summit in madrid last june but the move was UUUNKKK because of opposition by mrs. thatcher and west german chancellor helmut kohl 
 diplomatic sources said mr. kohl may now agree to set a date for the conference to make it clear that west germany is still committed to ec unity 
 the latest UUUNKKK in the equities markets UUUNKKK me of the joke t. boone pickens tells about the guy who was run over by the parade 
 when asked what went wrong the unfortunate victim replied it was a combination of things 
 and so it was on gray friday 
 the grand UUUNKKK of this parade would appear to have been excess leverage 
 even if that is so however it 's probably the case that no barriers should have been UUUNKKK to stop the UUUNKKK before the end of the rout e 
 the UUUNKKK began friday afternoon when word spread that the ual buy-out was UUUNKKK 
 although the UUUNKKK expects to patch together a substitute offer consisting of less cash the failure to get cash from japanese and american banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the UUUNKKK of UUUNKKK takeover deals is ending 
 lots of other UUUNKKK made up the parade of course notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices UUUNKKK federal reserve UUUNKKK and the bush administration 's temporary defeat in trying to lower the capital-gains tax 
 as usual few favorable reviews were heard for that UUUNKKK UUUNKKK band of program traders although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write 
 what really spooked the UUUNKKK along wall street however was the sudden concern that whatever the reason the pool of debt capital is UUUNKKK up 
 gray friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers rather than the small investor as their highly UUUNKKK investments in the deal stocks are UUUNKKK by the unexpected UUUNKKK up of the UUUNKKK for deal financing 
 deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses 
 ual which triggered the slide opened monday at $ N down about N N from thursday 's close 
 amr opened monday at $ N down nearly N N from thursday 's close 
 both took further hits yesterday 
 hilton lost N N on friday paramount lost almost N N 
 a careful look reveals that where deal financing has been secured the target 's stock price was not affected on friday 
 the multibillion-dollar prospects where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks UUUNKKK issue billions in high-yield debt were where the damage was concentrated 
 the market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for friday 's dramatic march for several weeks 
 the growing financial difficulties of recent UUUNKKK restructurings or takeovers such as resorts international integrated resources and campeau 's retailing empire have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities 
 investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by ohio UUUNKKK and by forcing ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring 
 as a result high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell $ N billion in junk bonds before year-end are experiencing anxious times 
 these are all market excesses putting aside the UUUNKKK boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity and what we 've seen is the market UUUNKKK them in 
 of course washington had n't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle and its tendency to UUUNKKK in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect but those preliminary steps should n't UUUNKKK us from the basic market UUUNKKK that was at work on friday 
 if it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and lbos caused gray friday what are the implications for policy makers 
 after all the stock market 's response to the collapse of the ual deal might be taken to confirm the UUUNKKK direction of regulators 
 is this a case where private markets are UUUNKKK of washington 's UUUNKKK of wall street 
 absolutely not 
 to the extent that friday 's sell-off reflected a sudden UUUNKKK of the excesses of leverage the message is that wall street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior 
 the national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various lbo deals and leveraged restructurings 
 the recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the UUUNKKK of bank capital for recent deals UUUNKKK the wisdom of letting the free markets operate 
 if takeover premiums become excessive if lbo UUUNKKK become too aggressive then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers and the markets will move with UUUNKKK speed to impose appropriate sanctions 
 yes the broader exchanges got caught up in the UUUNKKK but they rode the tiger up all year 
 not surprisingly he sometimes UUUNKKK 
 the arbitragers and takeover UUUNKKK got killed on gray friday while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered UUUNKKK 
 if you identify with the besieged managers you must concede that UUUNKKK and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from washington 
 if you side with the arbitragers and raiders you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators although the delaware courts should never be underestimated 
 the truth is washington understands politics better than economics 
 although the average citizen is probably not UUUNKKK too much from washington 's UUUNKKK war against wall street regarding excessive financial UUUNKKK actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm 
 any such attempt to UUUNKKK good debt from bad debt or to draw the line at a particular industry such as the airlines is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general 
 far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs panama and the deficit all of them UUUNKKK that seem never to end

 tokyo share prices rebounded tuesday morning with the nikkei index of N selected stocks rising N points to close the morning session at N 
 the index slid N points or N N on monday 
 in the first N minutes of tuesday 's trading the nikkei index soared N points to N 
 by N a.m. tokyo time the index was up N points to N as investors hailed new york 's overnight rally 
 monday 's slide came in a relatively calm session that did n't provide much direction for other markets 
 shares also closed sharply lower across europe particularly in frankfurt although london and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began to rebound in new york 
 other asian and pacific markets had sharper losses than tokyo but the selling wave stopped short of UUUNKKK another market crash 
 all eyes were on tokyo at the opening because it was the first major market to trade since friday 's 190.58-point plunge on wall street 
 but rather than set the tone for other markets japan 's major institutional investors chose to remain on the sidelines 
 still despite the sudden UUUNKKK of stock-market turbulence managers of japanese investment funds said they were n't planning to unload u.s. or european equities 
 we did n't trade much today as our policy now is to wait and see said a fund manager at UUUNKKK life insurance co 
 we would like to wait and see until trading goes around through europe and new york 
 the institutions appeared confident that japanese regulators would step in to ensure orderly trading if necessary and there was considerable speculation during the day that the finance ministry was working behind the scenes to do just that 
 but in the absence of UUUNKKK trading its presence was never UUUNKKK felt 
 at the close the nikkei average of N stocks stood at N down N points or N N 
 the broader tokyo stock price index sank N or N N to N 
 the day 's decline was generally in line with analysts ' weekend predictions 
 declining issues UUUNKKK advancers N 
 but volume was thin at N million shares compared with N million friday 
 the market opened sharply lower with the nikkei average down nearly N after N minutes 
 a midmorning rebound brought it back to show a gain of about N at the end of the morning session but the rally failed in the afternoon and the market closed near the day 's low 
 the smaller stocks in the tokyo market 's second section also posted their biggest decline of the year 
 the tokyo stock exchange index for the second section fell N or N N to N 
 many investors trying to outperform the market 's major indexes have UUUNKKK to these small issues in recent weeks 
 japanese investors and traders expressed relief that the tokyo market did n't fall more sharply 
 but its performance did bear some UUUNKKK to events of two years ago during the october N global stock market crash 
 on oct. N N the friday before the black monday crash the new york market dropped N N and tokyo followed on monday with a N N drop 
 this time wall street 's plunge of N N friday was followed by yesterday 's N N loss in tokyo 
 two years ago tokyo 's biggest fall came the day after new york 's N N black monday plunge when the nikkei average fell N N 
 thus market participants yesterday were looking ahead nervously to wall street 's opening 
 but in new york yesterday the dow jones industrial average surged N to close at N on heavy volume of N shares although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market 
 UUUNKKK UUUNKKK a director at yamaichi investment trust & management co. called yesterday 's session a good scenario for japan 
 now we are looking for the time to place buy orders he said 
 for us institutional investors the chance for buying has come 
 UUUNKKK UUUNKKK general manager of the investment research department at UUUNKKK trust & banking co. also was optimistic 
 he described friday 's plunge in the u.s. as a fleeting event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity 
 unless there is a panic this is the best time to buy as was the case two years ago he said 
 those shares which had posted gains on UUUNKKK speculation were dashed with cold water but as far as major stocks are concerned there is n't much impact 
 other fund managers were similarly UUUNKKK 
 we have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities said UUUNKKK UUUNKKK chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at UUUNKKK trust & banking co 
 he said friday 's wall street decline was well within the range of volatility that UUUNKKK trust plans for when it charts its overseas investment strategy 
 among other asian and pacific markets malaysia and singapore had the biggest losses with the kuala lumpur composite index in malaysia falling N N and singapore 's UUUNKKK times industrial index down N N 
 major indexes declined more than N N in australia and new zealand and N N in hong kong 
 UUUNKKK manila seoul taipei and UUUNKKK escaped with slightly smaller losses 
 brokers and fund managers said the region 's markets were reacting to friday 's wall street plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as failed corporate buy-outs and a deteriorating junk-bond market 
 it 's pure psychology said william UUUNKKK UUUNKKK an account executive for drexel burnham lambert UUUNKKK ltd. in hong kong 
 markets in this region are n't so geared to leveraged buy-outs and their economies generally are in good shape but there 's no doubt that asia is still following america 's lead 
 several analysts said malaysia and singapore had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows 
 hong kong is the region 's next most open market but many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in june amid political turmoil in china 
 singapore took the hit because when people want to get out they tend to go where the liquidity is said elizabeth hambrecht a regional analyst with baring securities hong kong ltd 
 she pointed out that even after monday 's N N decline the UUUNKKK times index is up N N this year so investors who UUUNKKK out generally did so profitably 
 similarly kuala lumpur 's composite index yesterday ended N N above its N close 
 in hong kong the hang seng index fell N to finish at N 
 trading was heavy at about one billion shares compared with N million friday 
 but the session was orderly in contrast to the market 's four-day UUUNKKK after the N crash 
 richard UUUNKKK a director at hong UUUNKKK baring international fund managers ltd. said the market probably has n't hit bottom yet but is close 
 if new york does n't collapse i see maybe another N N on the downside not counting the risk of bad news out of china he said 
 in australia sydney 's all UUUNKKK index closed at N down N N its biggest drop since october N 
 but volume rose only to N million shares from N million friday 
 UUUNKKK UUUNKKK an analyst at brokerage firm UUUNKKK UUUNKKK & young ltd. described the market 's performance as UUUNKKK as investors fled to UUUNKKK australian stocks and UUUNKKK entrepreneurial companies they perceived as having any takeover premium built into the price 
 london 's financial times-stock exchange 100-share index the most closely watched market barometer ended at its intraday high of N down N or N N

 the financial times 30-share index closed N points lower at N 
 volume more than doubled to N million shares from N million friday 
 prices on the frankfurt stock exchange tumbled in heavy trading 
 the decline in the german stock index of N points or N N to N was the frankfurt market 's UUUNKKK fall ever 
 retail investors dumped holdings on a massive scale pushing some blue-chip shares down as much as N N 
 analysts cited memories of two years ago when many small investors held on to their shares after the october crash but the west german market continued to decline UUUNKKK for the next three months 
 here are price trends on the world 's major stock markets as calculated by morgan stanley capital international perspective geneva

 frank lloyd wright is reported to have said once that if you UUUNKKK the world on its side everything loose would end up in california 
 we 've always thought that mr. wright underestimated california 's UUUNKKK but maybe the state 's UUUNKKK UUUNKKK are starting to UUUNKKK the forces that made it such a significant place 
 what else is one to make of the UUUNKKK UUUNKKK initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state 's attorney general 
 if passed by the voters the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides reduce carbon dioxide emissions by N N ban new offshore drilling ban chemicals thought to UUUNKKK the ozone layer and create a new state environmental officer armed with a $ N million budget to sue any firm or agency he thinks is being too UUUNKKK 
 the initiative is based largely on the UUUNKKK of the green lobby the sierra club the league of conservation voters the natural resources defense council the national UUUNKKK campaign and the citizens for a better environment 
 UUUNKKK the environmental defense fund is having nothing to do with this one 
 not only californians but all americans would pay if this thing passed 
 the initiative bars the sale of any crops in california that do n't meet the initiative 's standards 
 kansas wheat farmers and florida fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the california market 
 in other words california is UUUNKKK to take control of the nation 's farm policy 
 as usual the green lobby 's proposal is UUUNKKK from scientific reality 
 consider the UUUNKKK provision 
 the proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of N N 
 even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory it is UUUNKKK that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem 
 but if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative what is going on 
 the first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit 
 the key here is the UUUNKKK of state attorney general john van de UUUNKKK 
 he 's running for governor 
 mr. van de UUUNKKK is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and UUUNKKK them into a single UUUNKKK initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on nov. N N 
 that 's also the day of the gubernatorial election 
 the initiative seems to have been UUUNKKK to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy hollywood UUUNKKK who UUUNKKK money 
 and it allows mr. van de UUUNKKK to get around campaign spending limits 
 he can spend the legal maximum for his campaign all the spending for the van de UUUNKKK initiative on which there are no limits is UUUNKKK 
 this initiative is being labeled the big green but maybe it should be called the big UUUNKKK 
 the republican candidate sen. pete wilson is playing the initiative UUUNKKK game too UUUNKKK his own crime initiative 
 while it is possible that the big green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional it is of course UUUNKKK that in modern california it could slide through 
 this is the state that recently passed the UUUNKKK N UUUNKKK initiative 
 if this new proposal ever does become law the green lobby will benefit directly 
 the initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he does n't like 
 that means the UUUNKKK and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation taxpayers would bear the cost 
 mr. van de UUUNKKK and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and UUUNKKK issue among certain segments of california 's population now that almost any collection of UUUNKKK UUUNKKK nonsense can pass under its UUUNKKK 
 of course the state 's liberals are not yet a nation UUUNKKK themselves 
 george bush for example may decide that he does n't want to be the president who lost control of interstate commerce to an attorney general from california 
 and some other segments of california 's political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state 's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs 
 this UUUNKKK initiative will help california define itself for the future either as a state still UUUNKKK to economic and scientific reality or as one being led to wherever its UUUNKKK activists want to take it

 spurred by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks the dow jones industrial average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of friday 's 190.58-point plunge gaining N to N 
 it was the UUUNKKK advance for the average of N blue chips on UUUNKKK new york stock exchange volume of N shares the highest since the days after the N crash 
 while the advance cheered investors who feared a UUUNKKK crash would occur yesterday it was strictly a UUUNKKK rally fed by huge buying by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders 
 a troubling sign declining stocks on the big board outnumbered advancers N to N and the over-the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of friday 's late big board plunge 
 the nasdaq otc index closed down N to N 
 meanwhile in a divergence in two of the market 's most important indicators the dow industrials ' sister average the UUUNKKK dow jones transportation average tumbled N to N its UUUNKKK decline next to the UUUNKKK fall during the N crash 
 UUUNKKK plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks ual and amr which each fell more than N N when they reopened for trading yesterday after being suspended friday afternoon 
 ual the takeover stock at the center of friday 's 190.58-point market plunge fell N N to N N on nearly N million shares 
 overall this is a UUUNKKK rally but it 's very selective said arthur UUUNKKK jr. a veteran painewebber inc. trader at the big board 
 everyone was a little concerned about the general UUUNKKK of the rally and failure of the otc market to get into plus territory 
 it 's just a strange feeling 
 i do n't think anyone left the place UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 
 the rally gave UUUNKKK at least for now to the UUUNKKK declaration of big board chairman john j. phelan jr. that friday 's market debacle was an UUUNKKK condition and not a disaster 
 but to traders it looked like disaster on the N a.m. opening bell 
 the dow jones industrial average opened down N shortly after N 
 but most of the N blue-chip stocks in the average including eastman kodak and general motors could n't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from friday 's UUUNKKK rout 
 at N procter & gamble one of the most important dow UUUNKKK of late opened down N N to N 
 the dow dropped to a quick UUUNKKK loss and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble 
 more stocks opened over the UUUNKKK half hour as the N big board specialist firms in charge of keeping the market orderly UUUNKKK to find buy orders from major brokerage firms to match the selling flood 
 then to make matters worse computerized sell programs kicked in UUUNKKK stocks into UUUNKKK losses 
 there was heavy stock-index arbitrage as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets 
 this was a UUUNKKK from friday when standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks 
 the UUUNKKK of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized 
 they did n't 
 the dow accelerated its slide losing N in the first N minutes of trading 
 with program traders seemingly in charge buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall 
 then at N the dow suddenly started to rebound and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the UUUNKKK fall 
 and this time it was n't just the program traders who were responsible 
 all the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily 
 the program traders were in there too of course 
 but according to one trader the programmers did n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was also a lot of bargain-hunting by institutions 
 UUUNKKK m. UUUNKKK director of the new jersey division of investment which oversees $ N billion in investments said the first thing we did was to double our orders yesterday morning 
 with the market down like this we 'll probably take another $ N million and put it in the market 
 trading in walt disney co. particularly caught traders ' eyes 
 according to big board officials disney had one of the biggest UUUNKKK imbalances on friday it was one of the seven stocks that could n't finish trading that day 
 the stock opened late at N N down N N 
 but then it shot upward N N as goldman sachs & co. stepped in and bought traders said 
 however disney specialist robert UUUNKKK said i would be surprised if goldman represented N N of the opening volume 
 around wall street trading desks were relieved that they could at least play the market yesterday in contrast to friday 's gridlock 
 at donaldson lufkin & jenrette inc. head equity trader UUUNKKK UUUNKKK said i think the opening was UUUNKKK 
 it was orderly 
 we put some orders together 
 there was n't a lot of panic selling either domestically or internationally 
 not like friday where they just took the market apart 
 still the market had n't yet crossed into positive territory and traders were UUUNKKK 
 but in another dramatic burst the dow tacked on N points in five minutes and at N the index showed a gain of N 
 on the big board floor and on trading desks traders UUUNKKK their approval 
 UUUNKKK UUUNKKK peck a trader in shearson lehman hutton inc. 's otc department i tell you this market acts healthy 
 around him scores of traders seemed to get a burst of energy their boss broke out bottles of UUUNKKK water to cool them off 
 among big board specialists the cry was pull your offers meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares 
 it was UUUNKKK on the upside said one big board specialist 
 but not everybody was making money 
 the UUUNKKK on the chicago board options exchange the nation 's major options market was heavy after the trading in s&p N stock-index options was halted friday 
 many market makers in the s&p N index options contract had bullish positions friday and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses 
 over the weekend clearing firms told the chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost monday morning 
 they were absolutely killed UUUNKKK said one chicago-based options trader 
 some traders said that the closely watched major market index whose N stocks mimic the dow industrials did n't lead yesterday 's big rally 
 james UUUNKKK a partner at specialist UUUNKKK & UUUNKKK said the difference between today and two years ago terrible tuesday oct. N N is that then we needed a UUUNKKK to go into the major market index spend $ N million and get the program rally started 
 this time institutions saw the programs coming and backed away and backed away 
 then when the market was at a technical level to buy they came in with a UUUNKKK 
 however according to one analyst the timing of major market index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of terrible tuesday 
 futures were pulling the stock market higher said donald UUUNKKK head of stock-index futures research at prudential-bache securities inc 
 although the big board 's specialist firms struggled through another highly volatile trading session their performance yesterday was better than during friday 's UUUNKKK chaos according to traders and brokers who work with them 
 specialists were criticized for their inability to maintain orderly markets during the friday plunge 
 but yesterday even with halts in such major blue-chip stocks as merck we expected the halts and it was n't too bad said donaldson 's mr. UUUNKKK who had been critical of the specialists ' performance on friday 
 according to a big board official while many stocks opened late there were subsequent trading halts in only three issues amr merck and UUUNKKK energy 
 merck is one of the most important stocks in the major market index 
 no sector of the market has been UUUNKKK during the past two days ' gyrations 
 yet from the dow industrials ' high on oct. N through friday 's plunge relatively good performances have been turned in by real-estate utilities precious metals and life insurance stocks 
 and yesterday the top performing industry group was oil field equipment issues 
 for example UUUNKKK jumped N N to N UUUNKKK rose N N to N N and baker hughes rose N N to N

 mr. phelan said that program trading strategies were n't responsible for triggering friday 's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer-driven strategies in recent months 
 some N million of the more than N million shares traded in the final N minutes of friday 's session when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated were UUUNKKK he said 
 program trades make up N N of the exchange 's volume on an average day but despite the increase friday it was certainly not something you would say UUUNKKK the market decline mr. phelan said 
 mr. phelan expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday 
 obviously every time we get this kind of reaction it 's going to make everybody nervous including me he said 
 he said that exchange officials had conversations with wall street firms throughout the weekend and that all the participants behaved very very UUUNKKK today

 the institutions ca n't be criticized for their behavior mr. dapuzzo said in an interview

 maybe they learned from experience

 the UUUNKKK greens wanted a washington federal appeals court to block today 's scheduled UUUNKKK long enough for them to ask the world court to order a permanent cancellation of the $ N billion flight

 of course it was 
 nasa should now sue for fines against all three UUUNKKK foreign and domestic for bringing this UUUNKKK case 
 a house-senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the continental u.s. and on all flights of six hours or less to alaska and hawaii 
 the restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less 
 the exemption allowed on longer flights to alaska and hawaii appears to be largely a UUUNKKK UUUNKKK for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years 
 by a N margin house negotiators initially rejected last night a senate provision covering all domestic flights 
 but the UUUNKKK compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions 
 as a practical matter flights from the west coast to hawaii would be covered as they are under the time limit but the language would exempt longer routes beginning for example in chicago or on the east coast 
 within the senate the ban has had aggressive support from sen. frank UUUNKKK d. n.j. who has used his position as a senate appropriations subcommittee chairman to UUUNKKK votes for the initiative 
 the measure is attached to the more than $ N billion fiscal N transportation bill within mr. UUUNKKK 's jurisdiction and the final compromise is UUUNKKK with more than $ N million in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports including denver 
 from the outset the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy to follow 
 but the industry retains support in the house leadership through the influence of grower states such as north carolina 
 majority whip william gray owes a political debt to southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the house and the philadelphia democrat used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban 
 although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest the underlying bill was the subject of UUUNKKK lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane but politically important projects of members 
 in a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees the house deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in florida illinois and pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the house floor 
 anybody can vote as they want said rep. william lehman d. fla. head of the house conferees 
 but if you make a request you should support the committee 
 within the federal aviation administration the final bill promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than N N from last year and total operations would rise to $ N billion a N N boost 
 the facilities account includes $ N million for denver 's ambitious new airport and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in philadelphia and michigan and the major carriers to denver united and continental 
 leery of the costs and critics say competition the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of denver 
 texas air corp. which owns continental and the air transport association were prominent in the lobbying 
 the industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for N N of the gates 
 but this was rejected in favor of much UUUNKKK language UUUNKKK the transportation department to review the costs of the first phase expected to cost about $ N billion 
 though smaller in total dollars the conference agreed to preserve an estimated $ N million in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports 
 the sum is more than double what the house had approved for the program but the list of qualified airports would be cut by N under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy 
 congress previously cut six airports this year 
 the impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying more than $ N for each passenger in subsidies 
 among rail and highway accounts the agreement provides $ N million for UUUNKKK including $ N million for capital improvements 
 and UUUNKKK grants for mass transit would be effectively frozen at $ N billion or $ N million more than last fiscal year

 sony corp. which has offered to acquire the UUUNKKK company is seeking to free its top executives peter guber and jon peters from an exclusive agreement with time warner inc. 's warner communications inc. so they can run columbia pictures entertainment inc 
 sony two weeks ago agreed to acquire columbia for $ N billion or $ N a share 
 warner sued sony and guber-peters late last week sony and guber-peters have UUUNKKK charging warner with attempting to interfere in sony 's acquisition of the two companies 
 guber-peters 's net income in the latest quarter compared with a net loss of $ N million or N cents a share in the year-earlier period

 congress has been critical of the bush administration for not sending enough aid to poland so it is getting ready to send its own version of a care package 
 last month the senate voted to send a delegation of congressional staffers to poland to assist its legislature the UUUNKKK in democratic procedures 
 senator pete UUUNKKK calls this effort the first gift of democracy 
 the poles might do better to view it as a UUUNKKK horse 
 it is the vast shadow government of N congressional staffers that helps create such legislative UUUNKKK as the N page UUUNKKK reconciliation bill that claimed to be the budget of the united states 
 maybe after the staffers explain their work to the poles they 'd be willing to come back and do the same for the american people

 the sudden flight to quality that triggered friday 's explosive UUUNKKK rally was reversed yesterday in a flight from quality rout 
 the setback in which treasury bond prices plummeted reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit-taking 
 it was a pretty wild day 
 our markets were closely tied to the stock market said joel UUUNKKK manager of trading at smith barney harris upham & co 
 friday 's flight to quality was no longer needed once the stock market found its UUUNKKK he said 
 some fixed-income investors had expected a further drop in stock prices after the nearly UUUNKKK drop in the dow jones industrial average on friday 
 that caused investors to UUUNKKK stocks and buy high-quality treasury bonds which are safer than other types of securities 
 but when stocks began to climb instead prices of treasury bonds declined 
 contributing to the selling pressure were UUUNKKK by several investment firms advising clients to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios

 the closely watched rate on federal funds or overnight loans between banks slid to about N N N last week down from its perceived target level of about N N 
 the rate is considered an early signal of changes in fed policy 
 traders said yesterday 's modest easing did n't stir much enthusiasm because it had been widely expected 
 in fact some economists contend that the latest easing started last week 
 others note that some investors were disappointed because they had expected a more aggressive easing

 some traders said the high-yield market was helped by active institutional buying 
 in particular they said firms such as first boston corp. and drexel burnham lambert inc. began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels 
 i think the willingness of securities companies to make markets for high-yield issues improved the sentiment for junk bonds said john UUUNKKK an economist at moody 's investors service inc

 on seventh avenue designers have been advancing the UUUNKKK look with clothing UUUNKKK done entirely in black and white 
 and classic black-and-white movies are enjoying a comeback on videocassette tapes spurred in part by the backlash against UUUNKKK of old films 
 the UUUNKKK is UUUNKKK back to black and white says richard UUUNKKK the general manager of eastman kodak co. 's professional photography division 
 until two years ago sales of black-and-white film had been declining steadily since the 1960s 
 but last year buoyed by increased use in advertising and other commercial applications sales increased N N and they are expected to jump at least that much again this year 
 photographic companies are scrambling to tap the UUUNKKK market UUUNKKK some black-and-white product lines and developing new ones 
 at kodak which largely ignored the market for years black-and-white film sales now account for nearly N N of the company 's $ N billion in film and paper sales annually up from N N three years ago 
 the rochester n.y. photographic giant recently began marketing UUUNKKK N one of the fastest and most sensitive UUUNKKK films 
 aimed at commercial UUUNKKK the film can be used in very low light without UUUNKKK quality says donald UUUNKKK of UUUNKKK newsletter 
 also trying to UUUNKKK a portion of the $ N UUUNKKK industry is UUUNKKK corp. a unit of UUUNKKK ag 
 UUUNKKK recently signed olympic gold UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK to UUUNKKK a new line of black-and-white paper that 's geared to consumers and will compete directly with kodak 's papers 
 slated for market by the end of the year the paper could have been introduced a long time ago but the market was n't there then says an UUUNKKK spokesman 
 the biggest UUUNKKK of the black-and-white revival is likely to be international paper co. 's UUUNKKK division known in the industry for its premium products 
 sales of UUUNKKK 's four UUUNKKK of black-and-white film this year are UUUNKKK growth in the overall market although the company wo n't say by exactly how much 
 we hope the trend lasts says UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 's marketing communications director 
 why all the interest 
 for baby boomers who grew up being UUUNKKK in color black and white seems UUUNKKK and exotic 
 it has an UUUNKKK almost UUUNKKK quality to it says owen b. butler the chairman of the applied photography department at rochester institute of technology 
 you can shift out of reality with black and white he adds 
 such features have been especially attractive to professional UUUNKKK and marketing executives who have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising 
 processing of black-and-white commercial film jumped N N last year to N million rolls 
 consider gap inc. whose latest ad campaign features black-and-white shots of hollywood stars artists and other well-known UUUNKKK UUUNKKK the retailer 's jeans and UUUNKKK 
 richard UUUNKKK the account manager for the campaign says gap did n't intentionally choose black and white to UUUNKKK its ads from the color spreads of competitors 
 we wanted to highlight the individual not the environment he says and black and white allows you to do that better than color 
 the campaign won a UUUNKKK award as this year 's best ad by a specialty retailer 
 even food products and automobiles which have long depended on color are making the switch 
 companies feel black and white will convey a stronger statement says marc l. UUUNKKK a chicago UUUNKKK who is working on a black-and-white print ad for UUUNKKK food corp. 's lean UUUNKKK 
 other companies that are currently using UUUNKKK ads include american express co. and UUUNKKK america inc

 one customer UUUNKKK UUUNKKK says she UUUNKKK a color portrait for black and white because it 's more dramatic 
 i show it to my friends and they all say UUUNKKK 
 it is n't ordinary like color 
 still most consumers are n't UUUNKKK black-and-white film into their cameras to take family UUUNKKK 
 one big obstacle is that few UUUNKKK develop the film anymore 
 typically it must be UUUNKKK to a handful of processors and may take a week or more to be processed and returned 
 black-and-white film costs consumers a little less than color film and processing costs the same 
 but for UUUNKKK developing costs for black-and-white film are higher 
 some companies are starting to tackle that problem 
 UUUNKKK for example recently introduced a black-and-white film that can be processed quickly by color labs 
 intent on wooing customers the company is also increasing its UUUNKKK of black-and-white photography classes

 other companies are introducing related products 
 charles UUUNKKK co. a leading maker of photographic UUUNKKK introduced last month a complete UUUNKKK UUUNKKK UUUNKKK targeted at UUUNKKK who want to process their own black-and-white photographs 
 the UUUNKKK which has a suggested retail price of $ N and has already become a UUUNKKK was introduced after retailers noticed numerous requests from parents for children 's photography equipment 
 it seems computers as UUUNKKK have UUUNKKK says ian UUUNKKK UUUNKKK 's chairman and chief executive officer 
 but some industry observers believe the UUUNKKK of black and white is only a fad 
 they cite the emergence of still electronic photography more newspapers turning to color on their pages and UUUNKKK improvements in the quality of color prints 
 black and white has n't made the same quantum UUUNKKK in technological development as color says mr. butler of the rochester institute 
 the color print today is far superior to prints of N years ago 
 you ca n't say the same with black and white 
 but when popular photography a leading magazine for UUUNKKK selected N of the greatest photos ever made for its latest issue celebrating photography 's UUUNKKK anniversary all were black and white 
 it 's got a classic spirit and carries over UUUNKKK says alfred UUUNKKK of professional UUUNKKK of america 
 that 's the appeal 
 UUUNKKK newspapers inc. said improvements in advertising and subscription revenue led to a N N gain in third-quarter profit to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share 
 sales rose more than N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 the sacramento calif. company also attributed improved performance to a lower effective tax rate and higher interest income 
 for the nine months the newspaper chain had almost a N N increase in profit to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share 
 sales grew almost N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 UUUNKKK publishes the sacramento calif UUUNKKK and UUUNKKK wash news tribune and other papers in western states

 agip s.p a. and societe national UUUNKKK UUUNKKK the state oil companies of italy and france respectively submitted an offer to buy UUUNKKK suisse s.a

 a spokesman for UUUNKKK said that the swiss oil concern was UUUNKKK the offer submitted last friday along with two other offers also submitted last week 
 those two offers were private and the spokesman refused to identify the bidding companies 
 the spokesman further said that at least two more offers are expected from other companies within two weeks 
 UUUNKKK suisse owns an oil refinery in switzerland with a capacity of N barrels a day along with a network of gasoline retailing outlets 
 while friday 's plunging stock market prompted new fears about the economy 's prospects a UUUNKKK indicator that has UUUNKKK UUUNKKK the economy 's ups and UUUNKKK by exceptionally long lead times points to a sustained rise in overall business activity 
 the barometer developed by analysts at columbia university 's center for international business cycle research here reached a record high of N in august the latest month available and the columbia researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then 
 the latest reading of N was up from N in july and N as recently as march 
 the august rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator which uses the N average as a base of N 
 in contrast the commerce department 's widely followed index of leading indicators while up in august has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year 
 its UUUNKKK behavior through much of N has prompted some UUUNKKK to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year 's end 
 but the far stronger showing of the columbia index makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely says UUUNKKK h. moore the director of the columbia facility 
 a leading authority on the business cycle mr. moore also is a member of the business cycle dating group the panel of private economists that decides for the government when UUUNKKK and recessions begin and end 
 the group normally UUUNKKK only when a change in the economy 's general course seems likely 
 no meeting is scheduled because the expansion shows no sign of going off the tracks mr. moore reports 
 based largely on the recent strength in their index called the long leading indicator the columbia analysts UUUNKKK UUUNKKK economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well 
 they expect a N N rise in N in the gross national product after adjustment for inflation 
 underlying this optimism is the index 's longstanding ability to signal recessions or UUUNKKK as the case may be by substantially greater periods than the commerce department 's index of leading indicators 
 over the full UUUNKKK war ii era the columbia index on the average has entered sustained declines N months before the UUUNKKK of recessions and turned up eight months before UUUNKKK 
 the comparable lead times for the commerce index whose components include the stock market are far shorter N months before recessions and only three months before UUUNKKK 
 the columbia economists also have UUUNKKK how the long leading index would have behaved had it existed in N before the stock market crash in october that UUUNKKK in the great depression 
 the indicator reached a peak in january N and then fell steadily up to and through the crash 
 it was an entirely different pattern from what we 're seeing now mr. moore says 
 a major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the dow jones corporate UUUNKKK index which is not a part of the commerce index 
 in august the bond measure was at its highest monthly average since early N 
 it also rose last friday while the stock market sagged 
 other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries the UUUNKKK version of the money supply adjusted for inflation and the volume of new UUUNKKK permits 
 notably UUUNKKK from the columbia index is the stock market which mr. moore says is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy 's UUUNKKK prospects though it still is useful for anticipating some UUUNKKK UUUNKKK and turns 
 as recently as N the stock market as reflected in the standard & poor 's index of N common stocks was rated by the national bureau of economic research as the best of the N leading indicators that then made up the commerce index 
 it was assigned a mark of N out of a possible N compared with scores ranging as low as N for the other components 
 the stock market has lost some UUUNKKK power analysts at the columbia center claim because of the growing impact of international developments 
 stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy mr. moore says citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets the UUUNKKK balance and inflows of foreign capital 
 he also feels that the rise of such UUUNKKK practices as program trading has diminished the stock market 's UUUNKKK to the economic outlook

 an american journalist now is standing trial in namibia 
 this is the place that world opinion has been celebrating over in the expectation that it 's going to hold an election 
 the most likely winner will be the UUUNKKK swapo rebels 
 the u.s. journalist 's crime was writing that the head of the commission charged with overseeing the election 's fairness UUUNKKK UUUNKKK was openly sympathetic to swapo 
 shortly after that mr. UUUNKKK had scott stanley arrested and his UUUNKKK confiscated 
 mr. stanley is on trial over charges that he violated a UUUNKKK issued by the south african administrator general earlier this year which made it a crime punishable by two years in prison for any person to UUUNKKK UUUNKKK or UUUNKKK the election commission 
 the stanley affair does n't UUUNKKK well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in namibia when swapo starts running the government 
 to the extent mr. stanley has done anything wrong it may be that he is out of step with the consensus of world intellectuals that the UUUNKKK guerrillas were above all else the victims of UUUNKKK by neighboring south africa 
 swapo has enjoyed favorable western media treatment ever since the u.n. general assembly declared it the sole UUUNKKK representative of namibia 's people in 
 last year the u.s. UUUNKKK a peace settlement to remove cuba 's UUUNKKK UUUNKKK from UUUNKKK and hold free and fair elections that would end south africa 's control of namibia 
 the elections are set for nov. N 
 in july mr. stanley editor of american press international a washington UUUNKKK conservative wire service visited namibia to report on the UUUNKKK election campaign 
 he interviewed mr. UUUNKKK head of a commission charged with investigating electoral UUUNKKK and reported that mr. UUUNKKK was openly sympathetic to swapo and indeed had defended its leaders in court 
 after mr. stanley 's article was published in two UUUNKKK newspapers mr. UUUNKKK had criminal charges brought against their editors publisher and lawyer 
 mr. stanley was arrested and charged along with the others when he returned to namibia this month 
 both the state department and the lawyers committee for freedom of the press have UUUNKKK mr. stanley 's UUUNKKK 
 mr. stanley 's arrest is the latest in a series of incidents that threaten to UUUNKKK namibia 's elections 
 both south african and swapo UUUNKKK are UUUNKKK voters 
 the u.s. is in the habit of arranging peace settlements and then UUUNKKK its hands over the UUUNKKK results 
 it now has the chance to UUUNKKK that record in namibia 
 state and the human-rights community should insist that mr. stanley and his fellow defendants be released and that the united nation 's monitors make certain that mr. UUUNKKK commission UUUNKKK election complaints from all sides 
 commodity futures prices generally reflected the stability of the stock market following its plunge friday 
 yesterday the stock market 's influence at first created nervousness 
 later however it became more of an UUUNKKK than a UUUNKKK force as individual markets reacted more to their own factors 
 gold the traditional haven in times of financial crisis continued its UUUNKKK UUUNKKK with the dollar rising early in the day as the currency fell and then giving up some of its gains as the dollar recovered 
 copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy 
 copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved 
 crude oil declined early but as the stock market retained early gains it too became stronger ending with a small net loss 
 trading in cotton and sugar was nervous and showed small declines 
 in chicago grain and soybean prices rose slightly 
 livestock and meat prices however dropped on concern that a financial crisis would cut consumption of beef and pork 
 in commodity markets yesterday precious metals futures prices were moderately higher as gold gave up some of its early gains and platinum behaved UUUNKKK first falling and then later rising 
 silver performed quietly 
 the spot october gold price rose $ N to $ N an ounce 
 the more active december delivery gold settled with a gain of $ N an ounce at $ N after trading as high as $ N 
 december silver was up N cents an ounce at $ N 
 platinum behaved more like an industrial metal easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy but recovering later as the stock market strengthened 
 gold was nowhere the spectacular performer it was two years ago on black monday 
 for one thing last friday precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its UUUNKKK nose dive so it could n't react to it 
 back on friday oct. N UUUNKKK the stock market declined during the day and gold prices surged as the stock market fell 
 the october N contract that day rose as much as $ N to as high as $ N and the more deferred positions due to mature as late as march N rose as much as $ N 
 on black monday oct. N N the october contract tacked on further gains rising to as high as $ N for a gain of almost $ N on top of the friday advances before giving up almost $ N of that at the close 
 yesterday 's october gain of $ N was UUUNKKK compared with that 
 one analyst peter UUUNKKK of UUUNKKK & co. new york said the gold market already had some good UUUNKKK technical factors that would have caused prices to rise with or without the stock market 
 what the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened said mr. UUUNKKK 
 there 's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further he said 
 he expects a drop in interest rates which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising 
 finally according to mr. UUUNKKK the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the august merchandise trade deficit when the figures are released today 
 this would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold he said 
 energy 
 worried that friday 's 190-point stock market plunge might be a UUUNKKK of things to come for the economy petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices 
 the u.s. benchmark crude west texas intermediate closed at $ N a barrel for november delivery down N cents 
 some analysts said crude was due for a correction UUUNKKK following several days of significant gains 
 but most market observers agreed that friday 's stock market drop is what UUUNKKK spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday 
 until yesterday futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong 
 the organization of petroleum exporting countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand 
 so any bearish indicator such as friday 's UUUNKKK drop in the stock market sends UUUNKKK through the oil markets as well 
 indeed after reacting early in the trading day to friday 's plummet futures prices firmed up again as traders took note of the stock market 's partial recovery yesterday 
 copper 
 futures prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that had been UUUNKKK prices appeared to be solved 
 the december contract declined N cents a pound to $ N 
 prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a UUUNKKK reduction in copper use 
 but the recovery in the stock market provided little help for copper as word spread that a three-month strike at the highland valley mine in british columbia was about over according to an analyst 
 highland valley is a large canadian producer and principal supplier to japan which recently began seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories shrank 
 last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle the contracting out of work by the company 
 now the analyst said only minor points remain to be UUUNKKK up 
 for all UUUNKKK and purposes an agreement appears to have been achieved he said 
 copper inventories in new york 's commodity exchange warehouses rose yesterday by N tons to N tons 
 london metal exchange copper inventories last week declined N tons to N tons 
 the UUUNKKK stocks decline was about as expected but the comex gain was n't 
 however this was brushed aside by concern over the stock market the analyst said 
 at one point in futures trading as the stock market firmed the december contract rose to as high as $ N but it was n't able to sustain the gain 
 it was simply UUUNKKK he said and selling by funds that are computer UUUNKKK helped depress prices 
 cotton 
 futures prices eased more in reaction to hurricane jerry than to any influence of the stock market 
 the december contract ended with a loss of N cent a pound at N cents 
 technical considerations following the hurricane which was a factor in the market friday caused prices to decline yesterday said ernest simon cotton specialist for prudential-bache securities new york 
 prices rose sharply friday as the storm approached texas and louisiana which is part of the mississippi delta UUUNKKK area 
 however after UUUNKKK the potential effect of the hurricane prices began to slip late friday mr. simon said 
 that selling continued yesterday and kept prices under pressure he said 
 UUUNKKK weather is being predicted for the high plains of texas and the northern states of the delta during the coming weekend mr. simon said 
 that has n't yet captured traders ' attention he added 
 sugar 
 futures prices declined 
 the march contract was off N cent a pound at N cents 
 at one point in early trading the march price rose to as high as N cents when the stock market recovered but the price then fell back 
 a UUUNKKK factor one analyst said was that india which had been expected to buy around N tons of sugar in the world market did n't make any purchases 
 india recently bought N tons and was expected to buy more the analyst said 
 another analyst thought that india may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market 
 india may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar it could buy at lower prices said UUUNKKK UUUNKKK analyst for shearson lehman hutton new york 
 at any rate she added india needs the sugar so it will be in sooner or later to buy it 
 farm products 
 the prices of cattle and UUUNKKK futures contracts dropped sharply because traders speculated that the stock market plunge friday will UUUNKKK in the minds of u.s. consumers long enough to prompt them to rein in their spending at the supermarket which would hurt demand for beef and pork 
 the price of the UUUNKKK contract for october delivery dropped its maximum permissible daily limit of N cents a pound 
 the prices of most grain futures contracts rose slightly yesterday out of relief that the stock market was showing signs of recovering 
 earlier in the session the prices of several soybean contracts set new lows 
 a broad rally began when several major processors began buying futures contracts apparently to take advantage of the price dip 
 knight-ridder inc. said it would report increased earnings per share for the third quarter contrary to reported analysts ' comments that the publishing company 's earnings would be down

 foreign stock markets which kicked off black monday with a huge selling spree began the day off by relatively modest amounts 
 the dollar after falling sharply in overnight trading to N yen bounced back strongly to N thus easing fears that foreigners would unload u.s. stocks

 shortly after completing the $ N billion acquisition of west UUUNKKK inc. in april mr. UUUNKKK 's holding company UUUNKKK inc. said it was considering the sale of cluett a leading UUUNKKK maker and one of west UUUNKKK 's biggest units

 the companies said the agreement is subject to UUUNKKK 's UUUNKKK of financing and to regulatory and other approvals 
 they said the sale is expected to be concluded by the end of november

 britain 's blue arrow plc intends to change its name to manpower plc and write off a chunk of the nearly $ N billion in good will realized in the takeover of UUUNKKK manpower inc 
 blue arrow chairman mitchell fromstein said in an interview that the two steps may be a prelude to UUUNKKK the world 's biggest UUUNKKK group in the u.s. 
 mr. fromstein disclosed the planned steps expected within a few months as blue arrow posted a N N drop in its third-quarter pretax earnings 
 the name change and good will write-off could help UUUNKKK blue arrow 's dominance of the u.s. UUUNKKK market and give it a more american image as u.s. investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after friday 's market plunge 
 u.s. holders now own more than N N of blue arrow compared with N N last january 
 in the u.s. market the recognition of the manpower name is UUUNKKK stronger than blue arrow mr. fromstein said 
 the moves also could UUUNKKK shareholders ' perception of blue arrow as a company in turmoil 
 it further UUUNKKK the concept that blue arrow is a thing of the past said doug arthur an analyst at kidder peabody & co. in new york 
 the proposed changes all make a lot of sense to me he added 
 in a widely publicized UUUNKKK coup mr. fromstein ousted UUUNKKK berry as blue arrow chief executive in january a month after mr. berry had forced mr. fromstein out as the $ N UUUNKKK chief of UUUNKKK manpower 
 mr. fromstein UUUNKKK his control in april by taking over from mr. berry as chairman 
 but the blue arrow UUUNKKK is n't over yet as the british government is investigating a disputed # N million $ N million loan which mr. fromstein has said was made under mr. berry 's direction 
 blue arrow was able to pull off the $ N billion takeover of manpower in N largely because different british and american accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for british companies 
 under british rules blue arrow was able to write off at once the $ N billion in good will arising from the purchase 
 as a UUUNKKK company blue arrow would have to UUUNKKK the good will over as many as N years creating a continuing drag on reported earnings 
 good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets 
 but with so many shares now held in the u.s. blue arrow reports its earnings two ways based on both u.k. and u.s. accounting standards 
 our balance sheets look like they came from alice 's UUUNKKK mr. fromstein said 
 the british version shows a handful of pounds of net worth following the N write-off of good will while the american version reflects $ N billion of net worth because almost none of the good will has been written off 
 mr. fromstein said he hopes to UUUNKKK some of the good will left on blue arrow 's u.s. books in one fell UUUNKKK but would n't specify how much 
 people close to blue arrow suggested the write-down would represent a sizable chunk with executives claiming prior management UUUNKKK the extent of manpower 's good will 
 that move along with the return to the manpower name could bolster the company 's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help 
 the number of u.s. temporary workers fell about N N in the N months ending aug. N after sliding nearly N N in july said kidder peabody 's mr. arthur 
 blue arrow blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended july N partly on slower earnings growth of UUUNKKK units in britain 
 overall pretax profit slid to # N million in the quarter from # N million a year earlier 
 richard g. sim the man credited with UUUNKKK applied power inc. from an UUUNKKK into a UUUNKKK player in the global market for UUUNKKK tools hopes to guide a similar turnaround at the company 's latest acquisition barry wright corp 
 the 45-year-old former general electric co. executive figures it will be easier this time 
 but analysts while UUUNKKK the acquisition say applied 's chief executive faces a tough challenge in UUUNKKK the two companies 
 barry wright acquired by applied for $ N million makes UUUNKKK equipment and UUUNKKK systems 
 the UUUNKKK mass. company 's sales have been UUUNKKK and its profits have dropped 
 last year 's earnings of $ N million including $ N from a restructuring gain were far below the year-earlier $ N million 
 besides spurring barry wright 's sales which were $ N million in N mr. sim must UUUNKKK its costs and product line 
 the question is how long it 's going to take barry wright to make a contribution says f. john UUUNKKK an analyst at blunt ellis UUUNKKK in milwaukee 
 the answer will help determine whether applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by mr. sim 
 the butler wis. manufacturer went public at $ N a share in august N and mr. sim 's goal then was a $ N per-share price by N 
 strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule in august N 
 the stock has since UUUNKKK trading around $ N a share last week and closing yesterday at $ N in national over-the-counter trading 
 but mr. sim has set a fresh target of $ N a share by the end of 
 reaching that goal says robert t. UUUNKKK applied 's chief financial officer will require efficient reinvestment of cash by applied and UUUNKKK of its healthy N N rate of return on operating capital 
 in barry wright mr. sim sees a situation very similar to the one he faced when he joined applied as president and chief operating officer in N 
 applied then a closely held company was UUUNKKK under the management of its controlling family 
 while profitable it was n't growing and was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital he says 
 mr. sim is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at barry wright as it has at applied 
 he also UUUNKKK an UUUNKKK UUUNKKK to develop a corporate culture that rewards managers who produce and where UUUNKKK is shared 
 mr. sim considers the new unit 's operations fundamentally sound and adds that barry wright has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger competitors 
 with a little patience these businesses will perform very UUUNKKK mr. sim says 
 within about six months things will be moving in the right direction he predicts 
 mr. sim figures it will be easier to turn barry wright around since he 's now in the driver 's seat 
 when he came to applied i did n't have the power to execute as i do today he says 
 he was named chief executive officer of applied in N and became chairman last november 
 at applied mr. sim set growth as his first objective 
 he took the company public in an offering that UUUNKKK applied about $ N million which helped launch the company 's acquisition program 
 sales climbed to an estimated $ N million in fiscal N ended aug. N from $ N million in fiscal N 
 the company expects that earnings which have marched steadily upward in recent years reached about $ N million or $ N a share in the fiscal year just ended up from $ N million in fiscal N and $ N million in N
